# Tura Router

Router owns agent registration metadata, CLI forwarding, runtime-worker
dispatch, and worker lifecycle. That is the dispatch layer, not a second tools
crate. `command_run` implementation logic and command alias canonicalization
both live in `crates/tools` (`commands::canonical_command`) and execute inside
the runtime worker.

This version keeps `command_run` as the only coding-agent visible tool. Internal
command ids such as `shell_command`, `bash`, `zsh`, and `apply_patch` are resolved and
dispatched by `crates/tools/src/commands`, not by the router. One visible tool
does not mean one module owns everything behind it.

## Layering

- **Gateway** forwards HTTP, persists UI/session state through `session_log`,
  owns provider OAuth credential lifecycle, and launches the router. It runs no
  agent loop and holds no in-process runtime.
- **Router** owns the agent registry, CLI forwarding, and the lifecycle of
  runtime workers. `POST /run_agent` resolves an agent spec, builds the worker
  environment contract, and dispatches a runtime worker subprocess (the
  standalone `tura_runtime` binary, `TURA_ROLE=runtime_worker`). Command alias
  resolution
  and handler dispatch are owned by `crates/tools`, not the router.
- **Runtime** (`crates/runtime`, package `runtime`) activates
  `AgentManagement`, assembles agent prompts/tools, and runs the MANAS loop. It
  is a library executed inside a runtime worker, never spawned directly by the
  gateway.
- **Provider** OAuth is the sole source of truth for credentials. Workers
  receive provider context through the worker environment contract and must not
  fabricate or bypass missing credentials.

Spawning is single-direction: gateway → router → runtime worker. The only
exception is **multi-agent dispatch from inside a runtime worker**: a worker
may invoke `tura_router run-agent` as a subprocess (CLI stdin/stdout JSON, not
HTTP) to spawn child sub-sessions for concurrent or recursive agent flows.
Internal runtime ↔ router communication is always CLI; URL/HTTP is reserved
for the external gateway boundary.

## Subcommands

| Form | Used by | Channel |
|---|---|---|
| `tura_router` (no subcommand) | Boot — Axum HTTP server on `TURA_ROUTER_PORT` | HTTP |
| `tura_router run-agent` | Runtime worker spawning a child sub-session | stdin/stdout JSON |

Both modes share the same `dispatch_run_agent` core.

## Session DB Data Path

Router owns `session_db` service lifecycle through `session-db-service`, but it
does not expose a session-log data bridge. Gateway and runtime helpers call the
session DB service directly through `session-db-call`; router IPC is limited to
execution supervision and service lifecycle.

`target\debug\tura_gateway.exe session-log` also uses the direct session DB client
instead of routing reads through the router.
