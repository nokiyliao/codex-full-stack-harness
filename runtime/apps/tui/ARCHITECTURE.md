# apps/tui Architecture

## Goal

`apps/tui` is Tura's terminal-facing client. The non-interactive CLI and the
interactive TUI are TypeScript/Node applications in the same package because
they share the same gateway path, not because the terminal should grow its own
backend. Both follow the repository's gateway/session/runtime boundaries and
reuse terminal interaction patterns only when they fit the current code.

The TypeScript CLI/TUI must not embed the agent runtime, provider calls, command
execution, config persistence, or session store. Those responsibilities already
exist in `crates/gateway`, `crates/runtime`, `crates/router`,
`crates/provider`, and `crates/tools`.

The first implementation target is a conservative, non-interactive CLI path.
The interactive TUI should share the same TypeScript gateway client, event
stream, output formatting, and API types after the command path is stable.

## Non-Goals

- Do not call `crates/runtime` directly from the CLI/TUI app.
- Do not call `crates/provider` directly from the CLI/TUI app.
- Do not run shell commands, tools, service workers, or managed services from the
  CLI/TUI app.
- Do not read or write `.tura/config.conf`, `.env`, or provider config files
  directly.
- Do not create a separate local session/message database for the CLI/TUI app.
- Do not make `/tui/*` shortcut routes the main implementation path.

## Terminal Interaction Goals

Tura should keep a compact transcript, clear status, resume flow,
model/session selectors, permission prompts, useful exit messages, and
deterministic automation output. All durable state and backend work still goes
through gateway HTTP and SSE calls.

Transcript rendering treats line-start ATX headings (`# ` through `###### `)
as marker-free bold text in ANSI/rich terminals and marker-free text in plain
terminals. Prose hashes, hash tags, and fenced-code contents remain literal.

## Session Log And Provider Diagnostics

The CLI/TUI queries past sessions through gateway APIs or the gateway
CLI bridge. It must not read `.tura/sessions`, `db/session_log`, provider logs,
or backend config files directly.

HTTP session-log routes:

```text
GET /session-log/workspaces
GET /session-log/sessions?workspace=<workspace>&page=0&page_size=50
GET /session-log/{sessionID}/records?page=0&page_size=100
```

Raw CLI bridge for scripts:

```powershell
'{"command":"get_session","session_id":"session-id"}' | target\debug\tura_gateway.exe session-log
'{"command":"list_session_records","session_id":"session-id","page":0,"page_size":100}' | target\debug\tura_gateway.exe session-log
```

Provider call logs are backend diagnostics under
`log/provider/YYYY-MM-DD/*.json` or `LOG_PATH`; CLI/TUI commands should surface
provider status/usage from gateway/provider APIs unless a developer explicitly
asks for local diagnostic files.

## Package And Directory Strategy

Keep CLI and TUI in one TypeScript package under `apps/tui` for the first
implementation. The non-interactive CLI and the interactive TUI share most of
the important code:

- `gateway/client.ts` for HTTP calls.
- `gateway/events.ts` for `/event` SSE parsing and normalization.
- `types/` for gateway DTOs and terminal-facing event types.
- `output/` for human, JSON, and NDJSON formatting.
- `commands/` for non-interactive CLI subcommands.
- `tui/` for interactive terminal UI state, reducers, rendering, and widgets.

Do not split `apps/cli` and `apps/tui` into separate implementations unless the
shared TypeScript gateway client first becomes a dedicated internal package.
Otherwise DTOs, event handling, completion detection, and permission behavior
will drift.

`apps/tui` should be a Node/TypeScript package, with dependencies limited to
client/UI concerns:

- `typescript` plus the repo's chosen runner/build tool, such as `tsx`,
  `tsup`, or the existing workspace default.
- `commander`, `clipanion`, or `yargs` for command parsing. Prefer the package
  already used elsewhere in Tura if one exists when implementation starts.
- Node `fetch` or `undici` for gateway HTTP.
- `eventsource-parser` or a small local parser for `/event` SSE.
- `zod` only where runtime validation materially improves gateway error
  reporting; otherwise keep DTOs as TypeScript interfaces.
- `ink` or another React-style terminal UI library for the interactive TUI.
- `chalk`/`kleur` only for human terminal color output.

Keep DTOs local to `apps/tui/src/types` at first. The gateway JSON shape is the
client contract; generated SDK types should only be introduced after the gateway
has stable OpenAPI for these routes.

## Gateway-Only Communication

All frontend/backend communication must go through `crates/gateway`.

Default gateway URL resolution:

1. `--gateway-url`
2. `TURA_GATEWAY_URL`
3. `.tura/gateway-active.env`
4. Build default: `http://127.0.0.1:4125` in dev, `http://127.0.0.1:4126` in release.

Every request that is workspace-scoped must send the current directory through
both compatible mechanisms until the API is fully documented:

```text
query:  ?directory=<workspace path>
header: x-opencode-directory: <percent-encoded workspace path>
```

The CLI/TUI app may only health-check and connect to gateway. Gateway is owned
by the gateway process tree, not by TUI launchers or direct crate calls.

Core endpoint map:

```text
health                         GET    /global/health
global events                  GET    /event
global config                  GET    /config
global config patch            PATCH  /config
workspace session config       GET    /session/config?directory=...
workspace session config patch PATCH  /session/config?directory=...
list sessions                  GET    /session?directory=...
create session                 POST   /session
session status                 GET    /session/status
get session                    GET    /session/{sessionID}
update session                 PATCH  /session/{sessionID}

send prompt async              POST   /session/{sessionID}/prompt_async

question reply                 POST   /question/{requestID}/reply

provider auth status           GET    /provider/{providerID}/auth/status
provider auth validate         POST   /provider/{providerID}/auth/validate
provider logout                POST   /provider/{providerID}/auth/logout
provider oauth authorize       POST   /provider/{providerID}/oauth/authorize
commands                       GET    /command
execute slash command          POST   /command
vcs info/diff                  GET    /vcs, GET /vcs/diff
services status                GET    /service/status
skills/plugins                 GET    /skill, GET /plugin
paths                          GET    /path
```

The `/tui/*` routes in gateway are shortcuts. The TypeScript CLI/TUI should
prefer the richer session/message/config endpoints, and only use `/tui/*` for
very small smoke tests.

`scripts/web-terminal.mjs` is a browser debugging wrapper around the built TUI.
Its pty shell can be forced with `TURA_WEB_TERMINAL_SHELL`; otherwise it uses
the user's shell, macOS `/bin/zsh`, then bash/sh fallbacks.

## Session Plan Commands

The CLI/TUI plan surface is a terminal projection of gateway session
task-management state. It must use the same routes as GUI and must not read
session files directly.
Terminal API types must stay benchmark-agnostic. Benchmark-specific prompts,
artifacts, and evaluator checks belong in e2e scripts, not TUI session models.

Current plan commands are backed by:

```text
GET    /session?directory=<workspace>&includeChildren=true
POST   /session
GET    /session/{sessionID}
PATCH  /session/{sessionID}
PATCH  /session/{sessionID}/task-management
GET    /session/status
GET    /session/{sessionID}/todo
```

Terminal plan display should prefer `session_display_name`, then
`plan_summary`, then task `task_summary`, then session `name`. A short session
id can be shown as metadata.

Task status values are:

```text
todo
doing
question
done
archived
```

Archived tickets are hidden from normal plan output unless the user passes an
explicit archived flag. The TUI may show archived counts in compact status
rendering.

Single-task patches use object `task_management`. Multi-task nonce-specific
patches should use `task_management.tasks[]` entries with `nonce_id`, matching
gateway's current patch semantics.

Schedule fields are UTC in gateway responses and requests. Terminal output may
format them in local time for humans, while JSON/NDJSON output should preserve
the gateway value.

## Non-Interactive CLI

The first command surface should be small and automation-friendly:

```text
tura run [PROMPT...] [--cwd PATH] [--session ID]
         [--model PROVIDER/MODEL] [--agent NAME]
         [--output text|json|ndjson] [--json]
         [--no-stream] [--timeout SEC]
         [--last-message-file PATH]

tura resume [SESSION_ID|--last] [PROMPT...]
            [--output text|json|ndjson] [--json]

tura session list [--cwd PATH] [--all] [--json]
tura session show SESSION_ID [--json]
tura session delete SESSION_ID

tura config get [--cwd PATH] [--json]
tura config set KEY=VALUE... [--cwd PATH]

tura provider list [--json]
tura provider status [PROVIDER] [--json]

tura permission list [--json]
tura permission reply REQUEST_ID --approve|--deny

tura command list [--json]
tura command run NAME [ARGS...]

tura status [--json]
tura completion SHELL
```

Root flags:

```text
--gateway-url URL
--cwd PATH
--json
--color auto|always|never
--verbose
```

`--json` is an alias for `--output json` where the command has an output mode.
Per-run `--model` and `--agent` flags are request-scoped and must not persist
settings. Persistent changes belong to `tura config set`.

## Run Flow

Use `/prompt_async` as the default execution endpoint because it returns
immediately and lets the CLI stream `/event`. Use `/message` only for simple
synchronous calls.

```text
parse args
  -> resolve cwd and gateway url
  -> GET /global/health
  -> GET /session/config?directory=...
  -> optionally validate --model through /provider/model/validate
  -> POST /session when --session is absent
  -> POST /session/{sessionID}/prompt_async
  -> subscribe GET /event unless --no-stream
  -> filter envelopes by directory and sessionID
  -> render events through selected output mode
  -> hydrate final messages through GET /session/{sessionID}/message
  -> exit with deterministic code
```

`/event` currently emits SSE data as:

```json
{
  "directory": "./workspace",
  "payload": {
    "type": "message.updated",
    "properties": {}
  }
}
```

The TypeScript client should parse this envelope first, then narrow on
`payload.type`.

## Prompt Payload

The CLI should send a frontend-compatible prompt payload to `/prompt_async`:

```json
{
  "messageID": "msg_cli_<uuid>",
  "parts": [
    {
      "id": "part_cli_<uuid>",
      "type": "text",
      "text": "user prompt"
    }
  ],
  "model": "openai/gpt-5.5",
  "agent": "thoughtful",
  "source": "cli"
}
```

Gateway already extracts:

- text from `parts[].text`
- frontend message/part ids from `messageID` and `parts[].id`
- runtime model override from `model`
- runtime options from fields like `variant` and
  `model_acceleration_enabled`

The same prompt shape should be reused by the later interactive TUI so terminal
clients behave consistently. Both CLI `run` and the interactive TUI default
`model_acceleration_enabled` to `false`; explicit saved config or run flags may
still set it to `false`.

## Completion Detection

Until gateway exposes an explicit `turn.completed` event, use conservative
completion rules:

1. Record the submitted frontend message id and initial message count.
2. Treat `session.status` with `idle` after submission as a completion signal.
3. Also accept a new assistant `message.updated` after the submitted user
   message when no busy status remains.
4. On timeout, call `POST /session/{sessionID}/abort` and exit `4`.
5. If gateway returns or emits error status, exit `1`.

After completion, fetch `GET /session/{sessionID}/message` and extract the last
assistant text part as the final result.

## Output And Exit Codes

`text` output:

- human-readable status lines on stderr
- final assistant text on stdout
- compact tool summaries, permission notices, and final resume command

`json` output:

```json
{
  "sessionID": "...",
  "status": "completed",
  "finalText": "...",
  "messages": [],
  "usage": null
}
```

`ndjson` output:

- one JSON object per event
- include raw gateway envelope and normalized event fields
- finish with a final `{"type":"cli.completed",...}` or
  `{"type":"cli.failed",...}` record

Exit codes:

```text
0 completed
1 gateway/runtime/provider error
2 invalid CLI usage
3 permission denied or cancelled
4 timeout
5 gateway unavailable
```

## Interactive TUI

The interactive TUI should reuse the same TypeScript `GatewayClient`, event
stream parser, gateway types, command parser, output formatting primitives,
completion detection, and permission semantics. Its job is local terminal state
and rendering only.

Recommended state model:

```text
GatewayClient
  -> EventIngestor maps /event SSE payloads into typed events
  -> AppState stores selected workspace, session, messages, todos, permissions
  -> reducer updates state
  -> Ink/terminal renderer draws transcript, composer, status bar, overlays
```

UI surfaces to port from the Codex TUI idea:

- transcript cells for user messages, assistant messages, tool calls, diffs,
  command output, and errors
- composer with multiline input and slash-command completion
- status header with model, agent, cwd, branch, service status, and token usage
- session picker for resume/fork/open
- model/provider picker
- permission approval pane
- todo pane
- diff viewer
- help/keymap overlay

The TUI should not invent hidden state. Every durable choice should be reflected
through gateway config APIs.

## Long-Conversation Rendering (Bounded Transcript Scroll)

Requirement: the transcript must stay responsive and fully navigable for
sessions with thousands of messages. A long history must never make the TUI
unresponsive or force the user to switch/abandon the session to recover.

The Codex-inspired repair plan for streaming smoothness, scroll stability, and
delta-only live rendering is documented in
[`docs/tui-streaming-render-plan.md`](../../docs/tui-streaming-render-plan.md).

TUI text deltas remain in `liveStreams` until the durable message handoff. If a
full `message.part.updated` snapshot arrives for the same message and part, the
reducer must merge its metadata without storing the already-streamed text a
second time; the live overlay remains the single owner of those bytes until it
is committed. GUI state does not use this TUI-only overlay.

Existing scroll system — preserve exactly, do not regress:

- `tui/render.ts:transcriptLines()` builds lines only from a tail of the message
  array, then `viewportLines()` / `smartViewportLines()` window the rows by
  `state.scrollOffset`.
- Scroll input: the reducer `scroll` action (`tui/reducer.ts`) clamps
  `scrollOffset >= 0`; Up/Down = ±1 line, PageUp/PageDown = ±10.
- `draw()` (`tui/app.ts`) repaints absolute per-line
  (`\x1b[{row};1H\x1b[2K{line}`) and emits **no newlines**, so the screen can
  never push lines into terminal scrollback.

These three properties — tail-bounded render, `scrollOffset` row windowing, and
newline-free absolute repaint — are the scroll contract. Do not switch to
newline-emitting frames, alternate-screen scroll regions, or unbounded line
building.

Gap to close: the render tail is a fixed `state.messages.slice(-100)`. It bounds
cost but makes older history unreachable — the user cannot scroll above the last
100 messages and `scrollOffset` saturates at the top of that window even though
the history exists in `state.messages` and in the gateway. For long sessions
that is the failure this requirement targets.

Required design:

- Replace the fixed `slice(-100)` tail with a **sliding message window** anchored
  on scroll position. The window keeps a fixed render budget (enough messages to
  fill a few screens), but its start index moves earlier as `scrollOffset`
  reaches the top of the rendered set and later as the user scrolls back toward
  the bottom.
- Per-frame line building stays bounded: never wrap/lay out more than the
  windowed message set, regardless of `state.messages.length`. Frame cost must be
  O(window), not O(history).
- When the window reaches messages not yet held locally, fetch older messages
  from gateway (`GET /session/{sessionID}/message`, paged) and splice them into
  `state.messages` **without moving the visible anchor** (no scroll jump). Until
  paged message retrieval exists, cap the in-memory window and document the cap,
  but never block the render loop on history size.
- Keep "stick to bottom on new activity" exactly: `scrollOffset === 0` keeps
  meaning "follow the latest", and streaming `message.updated` while at the
  bottom must keep the newest content visible with no jump.

Acceptance criteria:

- A session with 5,000+ messages keeps keystroke-to-repaint latency flat and
  equal to a short session.
- The user can scroll continuously from the latest message back to the first
  with no hard stop at 100 and no freeze.
- No regression in `npm run test:e2e` / `npm run test:stream` or the
  absolute-repaint no-scrollback guarantee.

## Config And Settings

Use the current Tura architecture:

- Workspace/session settings live behind
  `GET/PATCH /session/config?directory=...`, backed by
  `.tura/config.conf` through `crates/gateway/src/session/config.rs`.
- Global UI settings live behind `GET/PATCH /config`.
- Provider/model catalog and auth state live behind `/provider` and
  `/provider/{providerID}/auth/*`.
- Provider credentials and `provider_config.json` updates are owned by
  gateway/provider code.
- Commands are discovered by gateway from `.tura/commands`, `.opencode/*`,
  `command`, and `commands`.
- Skills/plugins are discovered by gateway through `/skill` and `/plugin`.

The TypeScript CLI/TUI may cache config for rendering, but it must treat gateway
as source of truth and invalidate local state after config patches.

## Session And Event Semantics

The TUI should treat `sessionID` as the stable root of a conversation. It should
hydrate on startup by calling:

```text
GET /session/{sessionID}
GET /session/{sessionID}/message
GET /session/{sessionID}/todo
GET /permission
GET /service/status
```

Then it should attach to `/event` and filter by session directory and
`sessionID`. Events should be idempotent because `/event` may replay or scan new
messages from the store.

Non-interactive `run` and interactive TUI turns should share completion
detection until gateway adds explicit final-turn events.

## Permissions

Permission handling remains gateway-owned.

Interactive TUI:

- poll/subscribe for permission events
- render a permission pane
- reply through `POST /permission/{requestID}/reply`

Non-interactive CLI:

- default to fail fast when permission is required
- show pending permission details in text mode
- emit the raw permission request in JSON/NDJSON modes
- exit `3` unless a future gateway-backed policy explicitly supports
  non-interactive auto approval
- never bypass gateway permission APIs

## Testing Strategy

The test suite should be layered. Keep fast invariant tests in
`apps/tui/tests/unit/**/*.test.ts` and use Playwright only where a
browser/xterm/user-agent boundary is required. Do not use live provider calls
for ordinary regressions; mock gateway scripts own the terminal surface, and
root live tests own release acceptance.

Fast unit and edge tests:

- unit tests for CLI parsing and output formatting
- gateway client tests against a mock HTTP server
- SSE envelope parser tests
- NDJSON golden tests for non-interactive `run`
- timeout and gateway-unavailable tests
- terminal capability tests for CI/non-TTY, dumb/unknown terminals, ANSI
  terminals, and rich user-agent signals (`TERM_PROGRAM`, WezTerm, Kitty,
  Ghostty, Windows Terminal, VS Code, xterm-256color)
- keyboard input tests for printable Unicode, control characters, escape
  sequences, and malformed key payloads
- terminal rendering edge tests for ANSI preservation, truncation, CJK width,
  emoji width, combining marks, narrow columns, and plain/rich fallbacks
- reducer tests for idempotent event replay, cross-workspace filtering,
  out-of-order streaming deltas, session picker stability, setting selection,
  error/notice state, and stale-session transcript clearing
- lightweight performance smoke tests for large wrapped/streamed terminal output
  so rendering regressions are caught before they become “why is my terminal a
  toaster” incidents

Interactive and browser tests:

- reducer tests for gateway event ingestion
- terminal UI snapshot tests for transcript/status/permission panes
- resize tests for compact and wide terminal widths
- Playwright web-terminal profile smoke for `/plain`, `/ansi`, `/rich`
- Playwright mobile user-agent smoke for small viewport wrapping and horizontal
  overflow checks
- Playwright regression tests for transcript history, composer wrapping, colors,
  xterm rendering, and raw ANSI/control leak prevention
- mock-gateway business tests for streaming, multi-session, refresh/replay, and
  local task workflows

Chat rendering owns only the mutable live tail. Once a live row has overflowed
into terminal scrollback, later stream deltas must preserve that terminal-owned
prefix and may only append new rows or repaint the reserved tail. Rebuilding the
scrollback for a live-content reflow destroys a user's middle viewport position.
While that live tail exists, newly stable messages remain in the same mutable
tail even if their timestamps place them before the active text stream. This
keeps delayed or completed command snapshots from being inserted into the
terminal-owned prefix; the complete tail moves to the cache only after live
streaming ends.
While a session is busy, assistant messages in the current user turn belong to
that mutable tail even before a live delta or running command identifies them.
This prevents a stable text snapshot from entering terminal-owned scrollback
and then being appended again when a later command update makes the same
message live. Completed command snapshots remain there until the session is
explicitly idle; command completion alone is not a safe cache boundary.
The Runtime feed must finalize a live text part with the exact accumulated live
text, so completion and later session hydration preserve the same paragraphs,
indentation, and rendered transcript.

Current app-owned commands:

```text
npm test                         # build + all tests/unit suites
npm run test:e2e                 # mock gateway CLI and web-terminal e2e
npm run test:e2e:profiles        # Playwright profile + mobile user-agent smoke
npm run test:stream              # mock gateway stream flow
npm run test:business            # local business suite
npm run test:live:*              # real gateway/provider acceptance, opt-in only
```

Coverage expectations by boundary:

```text
CLI parser/output        unit tests + mock gateway e2e
Gateway HTTP client      mock HTTP unit tests: success, HTTP error, timeout, concurrency
SSE parsing              parser/normalizer unit tests + stream e2e
Reducer/event state      unit tests for replay, filters, panels, sessions, settings
Renderer                 unit tests for width/wrap/truncate + render snapshots
Keyboard/composer        unit tests + Playwright xterm smoke
Terminal capabilities    unit tests for env/user-agent signals + profile e2e
Web terminal wrapper     Playwright profile/mobile/regression tests
Live release surface     root live tests only
```

App-local TUI tests live under `apps/tui/tests`: `unit/` for Node test suites,
`e2e/business/` for local business harnesses, `e2e/live/` for provider-backed
flows, and `live/` for app-owned live checks. App-local test outputs must go
under `apps/tui/test-results/<suite>/<run-id>/`. TUI release-entry scripts live
under root `tests/release/tui_release_*.mjs`, but their logs, summaries,
screenshots, and workspaces default to
`apps/tui/test-results/release/<profile>/tui/<case>/<run-id>/`. TUI benchmarks
should also archive outputs under `apps/tui/test-results/benchmark/...`; only
the compiled debug/release binaries are read from `target/<profile>`.

Release-entry acceptance tests that validate the registered release
command surface belong in root `tests/release/tui_release_*.mjs` for the TUI
surface. Root `tests/release/release_entry_*.mjs` owns CLI release-entry scripts;
`benchmark/` owns comparison and scoring benchmarks.

## Implementation Phases

1. Create the TypeScript package, root CLI parser, gateway client, DTOs,
   health/status, and config commands.
2. Implement `session list/show/delete` and provider status commands.
3. Implement `run --output ndjson` with `/prompt_async`, `/event`, timeout, and
   final message hydration.
4. Add human text output, JSON output, `resume`, and deterministic completion
   detection.
5. Add permission list/reply, slash-command execution, and completion
   generation.
6. Introduce interactive TUI state/reducer/rendering on the same client layer.
7. Add richer transcript rendering, diff rendering, model picker, session
   picker, and help overlay.

## Open Gateway Gaps

The current gateway is already close, but these refinements would make TUI/CLI
cleaner:

- explicit final-turn event or stable turn id in `/prompt_async` and `/event`
- `turn.started`, `turn.completed`, `turn.failed`, and `turn.cancelled` events
- SSE `id:` fields for reliable stream resume
- documented request/response DTOs for `/session/{id}/message` and
  `/prompt_async`
- one prompt payload for CLI/GUI/TUI
- stable error envelope for all endpoints
- explicit non-interactive session marker so `resume --include-non-interactive`
  can be faithfully supported
