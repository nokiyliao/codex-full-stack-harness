# Tura GUI

`apps/gui` is the Bun/Solid/Vite graphical client and gateway SDK workspace for
Tura. The app talks to `crates/gateway` through `@tura/gateway-sdk`. It does not
reach around that boundary to call Rust crates, provider code, tools, shell
commands, or session storage directly. One client path is easier to trust than
several clever shortcuts.

## Install And Build

From the repository root, `build-release` writes production binaries into
`target/release`; `build-debug` writes local debug binaries into `target/debug`:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-release.ps1; .\scripts\register-cli.ps1          # production (release -> target/release)
.\scripts\build-debug.ps1     # debug build
```

```sh
./scripts/build-release.sh; scripts/register-cli.sh           # production (release -> target/release)
./scripts/build-debug.sh       # debug build
```

The install scripts verify or install Bun where possible, install GUI
dependencies, and build/check the Rust services needed by the gateway.

Manual GUI-only commands:

```text
bun install --cwd apps/gui --frozen-lockfile
bun run --cwd apps/gui build
bun run --cwd apps/gui typecheck
```

## Running Locally

Start `tura_gateway` first, then launch the GUI dev server. The GUI only
connects to an existing gateway and reports an error when none is reachable:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.ps1 -Gui
```

```sh
./scripts/start.sh --gui
```

The GUI Vite dev server binds to `127.0.0.1` and defaults to port `5174` with
`strictPort: false`, so Vite may choose another free port if `5174` is busy.

Direct package command:

```text
bun run --cwd apps/gui dev
```

## Gateway URL Configuration

The SDK resolves the gateway URL in this order:

1. `?gatewayUrl=<url>` query parameter.
2. `localStorage["tura.gatewayUrl"]`.
3. `VITE_TURA_GATEWAY_URL`.
4. `http://127.0.0.1:4126`.

When using the start scripts with `-Gui` or `--gui`, the scripts set
`VITE_TURA_GATEWAY_URL` from `TURA_GATEWAY_URL` when present, otherwise from
the selected `-Port` / `--port` value (default 4126). The dev server starts
`tura_gateway` on that port.

Example with a non-default gateway port:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.ps1 -Gui -Port 4100
```

```sh
./scripts/start.sh --gui --port 4100
```

## Environment And Secrets

Provider secrets belong in the repository-root `.env`, loaded by backend
services through `TURA_ENV_PATH`. GUI code must not read `.env`,
`provider_config.json`, provider logs, `db/session_log`, or `.tura/sessions`
directly.

Runtime choices such as selected model, selected agent, provider auth status,
workspace directory, and session config are read and updated through gateway
HTTP APIs.

When no workspace or global language is configured, the GUI defaults to English;
an explicit saved language still takes precedence.

## Checks

```text
bun run --cwd apps/gui format:check
bun run --cwd apps/gui typecheck
bun run --cwd apps/gui build
bun run --cwd apps/gui test
bun run --cwd apps/gui test:e2e
```

Focused app checks:

```text
bun run --cwd apps/gui/app typecheck
bun run --cwd apps/gui/app unused:check
```

Tests follow the same shape as `apps/tui`: unit tests live under
`apps/gui/tests/unit`, local/mock Playwright flows live under
`apps/gui/tests/e2e`, and credential/provider/release tests live under
`apps/gui/tests/e2e/live`.

`bun run --cwd apps/gui test` runs only unit tests. `test:e2e` runs the local
mock-gateway E2E suite and intentionally skips every `live` script.

Release-entry live acceptance tests under `apps/gui/tests/e2e/live/business` start the
release gateway and validate a single real request, Snake, and password-zip CLI
refactor task through the GUI command surface:

```text
bun run --cwd apps/gui test:live:release
bun run --cwd apps/gui test:live:release:single
bun run --cwd apps/gui test:live:release:snake
bun run --cwd apps/gui test:live:release:password-zip
```
