## Bug fixed

Link the issue and describe what actually failed. Start with the behavior, not
the patch.

Fixes #

## Root cause and change

Explain the root cause, why the previous flow let it through, and why this is the
smallest fix that closes the hole.

## Regression evidence

- Smallest owning test layer:
- Failure before the fix:
- Result after the fix:
- Higher-level boundary coverage, if the failure crossed one:

```text
command -> result
```

If stable automation is not possible, explain the limitation and provide the
durable substitute evidence described in the
[contribution guide](https://github.com/Tura-AI/tura/blob/main/docs/contributing-guide.md#test-ownership).
