# Scripts

The scripts have a deliberately small job: build and register the two standard
Cargo output directories, and nothing more mysterious than that:

- `target/debug`
- `target/release`

Command entries:

- `tura_exec`: Rust one-shot CLI binary.
- `tura`: compiled terminal entry. Use `tura` for the TUI, `tura run "prompt"` for the TUI gateway client, or `tura exec "prompt"` for the Rust CLI front.
- `tura_gateway`, `tura_router`, `tura_session_db`, `tura_runtime`: backend services.

Important scripts:

- `install.*`: run the complete source installation by default: dependency
  setup, full release build, and user PATH registration. The root installer checks
  `shell_command`, `bash`, `zsh`, and `git` coverage on every platform, ensures
  user-local `uv`, Python 3.12 through `uv`, and `bun`, calls command-owned
  `commands/*/install.*` scripts, and runs Bun installs inside app/package
  directories. `--skip-uv`/`-SkipUv` requires command installers to be skipped,
  and `--skip-bun`/`-SkipBun` requires app installs to be skipped when Bun
  workspaces are present. Use `-EnvironmentOnly` or `--environment-only` to stop
  after dependency setup; partial dependency and check-only switches require
  that explicit mode.
  Windows adds common Git/MSYS shell paths before checking bash/zsh. macOS
  asserts zsh and bash and reports optional PowerShell (`pwsh`) coverage.
- `build-debug.*`: build Rust debug binaries and the TUI entry into `target/debug`.
- `build-release.*`: build Rust release binaries, the web GUI dist under
  `target/release/tura_gui_dist`, the TUI entry,
  and the Tauri desktop bundle. CLI/TUI artifacts and copied web assets land in
  `target/release`; Tauri bundle artifacts are produced by the Tauri CLI under
  the release target bundle directory. Tauri reads the release version from the
  root `package.json`, keeping installer and npm versions identical. Before
  bundling, the build scripts remove the generated bundle directory so an older
  version cannot leak into npm or GitHub Release assets. Release builds preserve local session
  DB/cache state by default; pass `-Clean` on PowerShell or `-clean`/`--clean` on
  POSIX shells when a build must intentionally remove repository-local session
  DB/cache files first. The build scripts only stop repo-owned backend/service
  binaries before rebuilding; they do not stop the interactive `tura` TUI or
  `tura_gui` desktop process. If a frontend executable is locked, close it
  explicitly and rerun. Pass `-BackendOnly` or `--backend-only` when a CI job only
  needs Rust release artifacts.
- `register-cli.*`: add `target/release` to the user PATH. No wrapper directory is created; the registered CLI command is `tura exec`. The POSIX script ensures `.profile` exists, updates shell profiles when present, and creates `.zprofile`/`.zshrc` on macOS so new Terminal sessions work.
- `unregister-cli.*`: remove `target/release` from PATH and delete a stale `cli-bin` directory if present.
- `start.*`: convenience runner for `target/debug` by default, or `target/release` with `--release`. The runner repeats the same shell coverage checks before launching; set `TURA_STRICT_SHELL_TOOL_COVERAGE=1` when optional zsh/PowerShell gaps should fail the run.
- `check-backend-quality.*`: CI smell gate. It runs backend Rust test-layout
  policy, Rust formatting, TUI formatting, Rust dependency policy, and spelling.
  It intentionally does not run `cargo test --workspace`; crate tests are owned
  by `xtask/scripts/run-ci-crate-tests.*`.
- `run-ci.*`: local CI orchestrator. It runs `check-backend-quality.*` first,
  then monitors crate tests, backend business tests, and TUI business tests in
  parallel.
- `run-release-dry-run.*`: release dry-run orchestrator. It runs install, the CI
  flow, and release artifact build without publishing.
- `scripts/npm/install-release.mjs`: npm postinstall release installer for the
  public `tura-ai` package. It uses the installed platform package such as
  `tura-win32-x64` and fails directly when that optional dependency is
  unavailable; postinstall does not download release archives. The installed
  runtime layout is `target/release` with
  `config/provider_config.json`, backend binaries, TUI, GUI dist, and Tauri
  bundle artifacts. After verifying the release files it calls
  `scripts/npm/cli-path.mjs` so npm installs register the `tura` command on the
  current OS. On Windows it resolves PowerShell from PATH, standard Windows
  install locations, or `TURA_POWERSHELL_PATH`; set
  `TURA_NPM_SKIP_CLI_REGISTRATION=1` to suppress PATH/profile changes in
  automation. Current npm releases do not run uninstall lifecycle scripts, so
  the package exposes `tura unregister-cli` for PATH/profile cleanup before
  `npm uninstall tura-ai` instead of publishing fake `uninstall` scripts. The
  npm release workflow builds CLI/backend/TUI, web GUI, and Tauri bundles on
  every supported platform. Desktop bundle failures block publication, and the
  release tag must match the root npm package version before builds run. The
  platform npm packages used by `npm install tura-ai` include the desktop binary
  plus the native installer bundle. All four platform jobs must pass before a
  single publishing job uploads any platform package to npm; GitHub Release
  assets are flattened into one collision-free set and uploaded once, after the
  platform and main npm publications succeed. The final asset gate requires all
  four npm tarballs, all four platform archives, and at least one native Tauri
  installer for each supported platform without assuming a fixed bundle count.
  Linux release runners install both AppImage patching and RPM packaging tools
  because the Tauri configuration requests every supported bundle target.
  Its local install
  verifier stages the freshly packed platform tarball outside the main install
  tree and points `TURA_NPM_PLATFORM_PACKAGE_DIR` at it, avoiding npm registry
  lookups for optional platform packages before those packages are published.
  The verifier checks the installed release files, verifies PATH registration,
  runs `tura unregister-cli`, and asserts the PATH entry was removed. The wrapper
  passes `TURA_RELEASE_BIN_DIR` so the compiled TUI resolves sibling Rust release
  binaries from the installed package.
- `scripts/npm/verify-npm-install-fixture.mjs`: fast multi-OS npm install
  verifier used by `.github/workflows/npm-install-matrix.yml`. It builds a small
  fixture platform package for the current runner, packs the slim main npm
  package, installs through `postinstall`, verifies release binaries and the npm
  `tura` shim landed, then checks CLI registration and `unregister-cli` cleanup.
  On Windows it intentionally runs the main install with PATH restricted to the
  Node directory so PowerShell resolution does not depend on `powershell.exe`
  already being on PATH.
- `scripts/npm/stage-main-package.mjs` and
  `scripts/npm/restore-main-package.mjs`: temporarily replace the repository
  `package.json` during `npm pack`/`npm publish` so the published main package
  contains only runtime files and the real `postinstall` lifecycle script. The
  repository package metadata is restored in `postpack`; the release workflow
  publishes the resulting packed tarball so npm registry metadata also reflects
  the slim runtime manifest.
- `scripts/npm/package-platform.mjs`: stages the current OS release into a
  platform npm package: `tura-linux-x64`, `tura-darwin-x64`,
  `tura-darwin-arm64`, or `tura-win32-x64`. A desktop binary and installable
  Tauri bundle are mandatory.
- `scripts/npm/package-release.mjs`: creates the matching GitHub Release archive
  under `release/`, for example `tura-v0.1.0-windows-x64.zip` or
  `tura-v0.1.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz`; each archive contains the same Tauri output.
- `scripts/npm/stage-desktop-release-assets.mjs`: copies native Tauri installers
  to `release/desktop` as platform-qualified GitHub Release assets named with
  the `tura-gui-only-` prefix, avoiding collisions between macOS architectures.

## Xtask test collection scripts

- `xtask/scripts/run-ci-crate-tests.*`: GitHub-style crate matrix runner. It
  discovers default backend workspace packages, excludes `tura_gui`, and runs
  clippy plus `cargo test -p <crate>` for each crate. Local runs can batch
  crates in parallel.
- Typed Rust test directories are peers: `tests/business`, `tests/os_testing`,
  `tests/performance`, `tests/live`, `tests/release`, and `tests/benchmark`.
  Business and OS testing may use `helpers/` plus target-owned module
  directories beside the top-level entrypoint; other crate-owned typed
  directories stay flat. Do not keep empty typed directories. The workspace root `tests/benchmark` is the manual benchmark
  exception and keeps historical second-level categories such as `bug-fix`,
  `frontend-playwright`, `project-rebuild-refactor`, and `tui`.
- Typed test runners discover cases by scanning the matching directory type.
  Do not add one-off hardcoded script paths when a directory scan can find the
  case.
- `xtask/scripts/run-backend-business-tests.*`: run root Rust business tests plus
  crate-owned Rust tests from `crates/*/tests/business`, `commands/*/tests/business`,
  `agents/*/tests/business`, and `personas/*/tests/business` using one-level
  typed-directory scans. Business targets run in parallel batches and the
  runner reports all failed `package::target` entries after the discovered set
  finishes. Process, daemon, service-owner, lifecycle, and OS policy coverage
  belongs to `xtask/scripts/run-backend-os-tests.*`. These backend runners do
  not execute `.mjs` app, TUI, or GUI scripts; run app suites from `apps/tui` or
  `apps/gui`.
- `xtask/scripts/run-backend-os-tests.*`: run root and crate-owned Rust tests from
  `tests/os_testing` with the `os-tests` feature gate. Every target runs
  serially with `--test-threads=1` to avoid process-global env, local socket,
  owner-lock, daemon, and child-process cleanup conflicts. The Windows runner
  preserves assertion failures but bounds each target and terminates its Cargo
  process tree plus repo-owned backend children before returning.
- `xtask/scripts/run-backend-live-tests.*`: run opt-in root/backend Rust live tests and
  backend-owned root live scripts using one-level typed-directory scans and the
  `live-tests` feature gate when the package declares it. These backend
  runners do not execute app-owned TUI/GUI scripts; run those from the app
  package commands.
- `xtask/scripts/run-backend-release-tests.*`: run opt-in backend release-binary
  tests discovered from root `tests/release/*.mjs`. TUI/GUI release entrypoints
  also live in `tests/release`, but the backend runner skips `tui_*` and
  `gui_*`; run those directly or through the app package aliases.
- `xtask/scripts/run-backend-performance-tests.*`: runner for crate-owned Rust
  performance tests from `crates/*/tests/performance`; each target is killed if
  it exceeds the configured timeout.

Script tests:

- `tests/scripts/test-install.*`: checks script syntax where available, runs the
  root dependency installer, and verifies command-owned Python environments.
- `tests/scripts/test-build-release.*`: validates a dry-run release probe such as
  `release-v0.0.0-ci`, runs `build-release.*`, checks expected artifacts, and
  verifies command protocol health. Pass `-BackendOnly` or `--backend-only` when
  a CI job only needs Rust release artifacts.
- `scripts/tests/scripts/test-backend-os-runner.ps1`: injects a fake Cargo
  process to verify that Windows assertion and timeout paths fail promptly,
  preserve diagnostics, and leave no backend child process running.

Source installation contract:

- `scripts/install.ps1` and `scripts/install.sh` run environment setup, the full
  release build, and CLI PATH registration by default.
- `-EnvironmentOnly` and `--environment-only` are the explicit dependency-only
  modes. Partial dependency switches and check-only mode must be paired with
  that flag.
- Internal release and packaging flows that build separately must invoke the
  installer in environment-only mode to avoid duplicate release builds.

GitHub Actions:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the smell gate first. After that, crate matrix
  jobs, backend business tests, and TUI business tests run in parallel with
  Cargo and npm caches. Tags starting with `release` trigger a release dry-run
  job after CI completes; the job builds release artifacts and does not publish
  a GitHub release.
- `.github/workflows/source-install.yml` runs the default complete source
  installer on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows Server 2022, and Windows Server 2025, then
  verifies `tura --help` through user PATH in a fresh shell and uploads logs.
- `.github/workflows/os-worker-tests.yml` runs the four current OS runners
  (`ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, `windows-2022`, and `windows-2025`) through
  install-script checks, backend release-script checks, and serial backend OS
  tests.
- `.github/workflows/npm-release.yml` builds the four npm platform releases
  (`tura-linux-x64`, `tura-darwin-x64`, `tura-darwin-arm64`, and
  `tura-win32-x64`), verifies a local `npm install` of the main `tura-ai` package
  against the platform package, verifies the slim main npm package contents,
  verifies postinstall CLI registration plus `tura unregister-cli`, uploads
  release archives, and publishes npm packages with the first configured token
  from `NPM_TOKEN`, `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`, or `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN`. Token authentication
  is checked before the four platform builds, and npmjs publishing explicitly
  disables provenance because this path does not use trusted publishing.
  A branch named `npm-release/<tag>/<run-id>` invokes the idempotent recovery
  path: it verifies the tag and completed source run, reuses that run's four
  platform artifacts, and resumes platform, main, GitHub Release, and GitHub
  Package publishing without rebuilding them.
- `.github/workflows/npm-release-assets-recovery.yml` supports a local-token
  recovery through `release-assets/<tag>/<run-id>`. It verifies and downloads
  the original four workflow artifacts, uploads their contents to the GitHub
  Release, and adds `SHA256SUMS.txt` so local npm publishing can verify every
  downloaded tarball without rebuilding it.
- `.github/workflows/npm-github-package-recovery.yml` handles the final
  `github-package-release/<tag>` step after all five npmjs packages and the
  GitHub Release exist. It verifies the immutable release tag, then packages
  the recovery branch source so npm installation contracts match the repaired
  platform packages, and publishes `@tura-ai/tura` with the workflow's
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Local source builds still resolve directly from `target/release`. Published npm
installs resolve through the main `tura-ai` package plus the matching platform
package. A missing platform package is an installation error; there is no
postinstall download fallback. Platform npm packages retain the Web GUI dist,
but exclude the Tauri desktop executable and the entire Tauri bundle tree.
Desktop installers and Tauri-inclusive platform archives are distributed only
through the GitHub Release. Release automation rejects any npm platform tarball
that contains `target/release/tura_gui`, `tura_gui.exe`, or `bundle/`.
