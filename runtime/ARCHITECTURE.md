# Tura Architecture

This document is the map of the current `tura` architecture. The design is
CLI-driven: runtime, gateway, provider, tools, and router behavior belong in
crates and command modules, not in a collection of independent long-running
services that happen to know about one another.

The project root is the repository root. Paths in docs and config are relative
to it. One root is enough; inventing another would mostly create archaeology.

## Operational Logs

### Session Log

Durable session, task-management, message, todo, and workspace session history
is stored by `crates/session_log` using embedded SQLite. `tura_session_db` is
the single service that owns the store and every other process reaches it over
the service socket. The per-instance index and durable write queue live under
`tura_path::home_db_dir()` as `index.sqlite3`; the full session log for a
workspace lives with that workspace at `<workspace>/.tura/session_log.sqlite3`.
dev and release builds therefore share a workspace's session log while keeping
their per-home sockets, locks, and indexes isolated.

Gateway and runtime must not write session state directly to
`.tura/sessions/*.json`. Gateway creates sessions and applies typed
`SessionCommand`s through `SessionDbClient`; creation commands own parent links
and task state. Runtime persists bounded context and record projections through
`SessionLogClient::persist_session_delta` and resumes sessions through
`SessionLogClient::get_session`, scoped by workspace.

Developer query commands:

```powershell
'{"command":"list_workspaces"}' | target\debug\tura_gateway.exe session-log
'{"command":"list_sessions","workspace":"C:/repo","page":0,"page_size":50}' | target\debug\tura_gateway.exe session-log
'{"command":"get_session","session_id":"session-id"}' | target\debug\tura_gateway.exe session-log
'{"command":"list_session_records","session_id":"session-id","page":0,"page_size":100}' | target\debug\tura_gateway.exe session-log
```

HTTP query endpoints:

```text
GET /session-log/workspaces
GET /session-log/sessions?workspace=C%3A%2Frepo&page=0&page_size=50
GET /session-log/{sessionID}/records?page=0&page_size=100
```

### Provider Call Logs

Provider call logs are written only by `crates/provider` under
`log/provider/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS_mmm_<call_id>.json` by default. `LOG_PATH`
overrides the provider log root. The file payload is a JSON `llm_call` record
containing provider, model, base URL, request, normalized response, metrics,
duration, success, and error/traceback fields. Do not store provider requests
inside session-log records except as normalized runtime/session events.

## Crate Names And Runnable Packages

Directory names describe architecture ownership. Cargo package names match the
owning directory names.

```text
crates/gateway     -> package gateway (binaries: tura_gateway, tura_exec)
crates/lifecycle   -> package lifecycle, library lifecycle
crates/runtime     -> package runtime (binary: tura_runtime), library runtime
crates/runtime_contract -> package runtime_contract, library runtime_contract
crates/session_log -> package session_log (binary: tura_session_db), library session_log
crates/session_log_contract -> package session_log_contract, library session_log_contract
crates/path        -> package tura_path, library tura_path
agents      -> package agents, library tura_agents
crates/provider    -> package provider, library tura_llm_rust
crates/tools       -> package tools, library code_tools
crates/router      -> package router, default binary tura_router
crates/router_contract -> package router_contract, library router_contract
```

Use the directory-matching package names in build, check, install, and start
commands.

`crates/lifecycle` owns the canonical Session and Runtime aggregates, states,
commands, events, queries, projections, and transition rules. Gateway, router,
runtime, and session-log services consume those types through the lifecycle and
contract crates; they do not define a second lifecycle state machine. The
`router_contract`, `runtime_contract`, and `session_log_contract` crates own
strict wire DTOs and clients only, and do not depend back on service
implementations. The resolved dependency and state-ownership constraints are
enforced by `crates/lifecycle/tests/service_dependency_architecture.rs` and the
Runtime / Session equivalence gate documented in
`tests/equivalence/runtime_session/README.md`.

### Binary topology (single backend pipeline, many thin fronts)

One isolated backend per **instance_home** (selected by `TURA_HOME`; derives all
sockets/locks/db via `tura_path`), reused by every front:

| Binary | Role | Instances |
|---|---|---|
| `tura_session_db` | **single SQLite session-store owner**; serves a concurrent socket IPC | 1 / home |
| `tura_router` | dispatch/registry/supervision; `serve-socket` runs it as the per-home socket daemon, publishes `addr/version/pid/process_start_time`, owns session_db, spawns runtime workers, and executes `command_run`; `serve` is the stdin/stdout mode | 1 / home |
| `tura_runtime` | per-session agent worker, spawned by the router, completes-and-dies | many |
| `gateway` | HTTP/SSE front (GUI/TUI); when launched by a front it holds a stdin lifetime lease and sends router heartbeat leases | 1 / home |
| `cli` | CLI thin front: probe-first connects to (or detaches) the router daemon, dispatches a turn, renders from session_db; `--embedded` runs runtime in-process against the shared owner | per call |
| `tura-command-*` | local tool binaries (read_media / web_discover) | per call |

Fronts never own the session database directly. They talk to the router daemon,
and the router owns session_db, runtime workers, and shell/tool child process
trees. GUI/TUI-launched gateways keep a stdin lifetime lease and send router
heartbeat leases; closing the front closes the pipe and exits gateway, then the
router observes that no valid gateway or exec lease remains and self-shuts down
after its idle grace, stopping runtime workers, router-owned `command_run`, and
session_db. Standalone CLI calls use a long-lived request socket; if that socket
closes mid-turn, router cancels the active runtime and aborts router-owned
`command_run` tasks for that connection. The router's socket IPC is
**`request_id`-multiplexed** (a slow `enqueue_turn` never head-of-line-blocks a
`health_check`).

## Architectural Boundaries

### `apps/gui`

The GUI is the browser/desktop client. It talks to backend behavior only through
`apps/gui/sdk/gateway`; it must not call runtime, provider, router, tools, or
shell functionality directly. The current GUI app is organized around one app
shell, page folders, feature modules, hooks, state, and style parts:

```text
apps/gui/app/src/
  app/
  components/
  conversation/
  features/
  hooks/
  mock/
  pages/
    files/
    plan/
    settings/
  state/
  styles/
    parts/
  utils/
```

Settings are intentionally limited to appearance, providers, and models. Other
settings categories must not remain as hidden frontend pages or sidebar entries.
All settings text goes through `src/i18n.ts`. Model settings are driven by the
gateway model config API and display tier options as provider/model pairs.

Frontend refactors must keep `bun --cwd apps/gui/app typecheck` and
`bun --cwd apps/gui/app unused:check` passing before merging. New page-level
code belongs in a page folder; shared state, formatting, and gateway behavior
belong in their existing shared folders instead of being embedded into a single
large component.

### `apps/tui`

The TUI is the TypeScript terminal client. It talks to gateway HTTP/SSE APIs and
must not call Rust runtime/provider/tool crates directly. CLI and terminal UI
code live together under `apps/tui`.

### `apps/tauri`

The desktop shell lives under `apps/tauri`. It hosts the GUI frontend and starts
the same gateway/router path used by browser and terminal clients.

### `crates/gateway`

Gateway is the middleware between the frontend and backend crates. It provides
the UI-facing API surface, forwards agent turns to the router, persists UI-facing
session data, owns the provider OAuth credential lifecycle, launches the router,
and streams backend events back to the frontend.

Gateway owns frontend-facing API routes, payload validation, session/thread/turn
APIs, UI/session persistence through `session_log`, event streaming, permission
request forwarding, provider config projection, OAuth credential lifecycle,
process/PTY adapters, workspace config, router launch, and `POST /run_agent`
forwarding to the router.

Gateway does not own agent loops, an in-process runtime, provider request
formatting, tool execution, shell sandboxing, file locks, command registration,
or CLI forwarding rules. It never runs the agent loop in-process; every agent
turn is forwarded to the router, which dispatches a runtime worker.

The `gateway` package also contains the direct Rust CLI binary `tura_exec`
(formerly `tura`). That binary is a local prompt-execution entrypoint, not the
HTTP gateway surface. As a thin front it never owns the session database: it
ensures the per-home `tura_session_db` owner is running (starting it detached if
needed) and connects to it, so its runtime persists through the single DB
owner. Its default
text output contract is intentionally script-friendly: only the final assistant
message is printed to `stdout`; lightweight runtime/tool progress is printed to
`stderr`; `--quiet`/`--silent` suppresses that progress; `--json` uses `stdout`
JSONL events instead of final-text mode.

### `crates/runtime`

Runtime is the agent orchestration crate. It uses the MANO/MANAS split as
internal modules. Runtime is a
library executed inside a runtime worker — the standalone `tura_runtime` binary
(`TURA_ROLE=runtime_worker`) dispatched by the router after a version handshake.
It is never spawned directly by the gateway and does not bind a fixed service port.

Runtime owns session creation/resume, agent activation, state machines, prompt
assembly, tool catalog selection, one provider turn at a time, tool-call
**consumption** (not parsing — that's provider-side), tool execution
orchestration through `crates/tools`, gateway event publishing,
final-response forcing, and session completion. Runtime emits/consumes the
canonical OpenAI Responses-API content shape only.

Runtime does not own:

- provider auth or any per-provider format branch (response parsing,
  `<thought>` stripping, prompt-cache key flag, SSE usage flag, unsupported
  content-type fallback) — these live in `crates/provider`;
- shell execution details, file locks, router command registration, CLI
  forwarding, or runtime-worker dispatch.

For multi-agent dispatch, runtime spawns child sub-sessions by invoking
`tura_router run-agent` as a subprocess (stdin/stdout JSON). It never calls
the router or gateway over HTTP/URL. See `crates/runtime/src/manas/child_dispatch.rs`.

### `agents`

Agents are configured under `agents`.

Agents own identity, default prompts, provider defaults, command selections,
planning/multiple-task defaults, and static or dynamic agent configuration.
Runtime loads agent config from this crate instead of hard-coding agent
defaults.

Current agent-owned files live under:

```text
agents/src/<agent_id>/
  agent_config.json
  prompt.md
```

Agent-specific prompt text stays in `prompt.md`. Persona resources are
independent from agent configuration. Runtime prompt fragments and command
prompts are injected separately by their owning crates.

### `crates/provider`

Provider owns model access and model-account control: route lookup, model
aliases, auth/token resolution, OAuth/login state, provider settings,
pause/resume controls, retry/backoff, streaming and non-streaming calls,
response normalization, tool-call normalization, token usage, cost records,
monitoring, and logs.

Runtime decides what to do with provider output. Provider only performs and
normalizes model calls.

OpenAI OAuth discovery and refresh are Provider responsibilities. OAuth mode is
selected from `OPENAI_LOGIN=oauth`, `provider_auth.openai.login=oauth`, or local
Codex auth discovery through `CODEX_HOME/auth.json` / `~/.codex/auth.json`.
Provider must propagate access token, refresh token, and account id into the
OpenAI Codex responses call path and must surface refresh failures instead of
falling back to an empty API key.

### `crates/tools`

Tools owns the model-visible tool layer and command execution.

Tools owns:

- The compact `command_run` visible tool.
- Command handlers under `crates/tools/commands`.
- Command prompts, schemas, handlers, and policies.
- Runtime validation.
- Permission checks.
- Sandbox policy.
- File locks.
- Audit records.
- Output truncation and display-ready normalization.
- `shell_command`, `bash`, `zsh`, `apply_patch`, `read_media`, and future commands.
- mode-gated commands such as `compact_context` and `planning`.
- `task_status` as an internal command inside `command_run`, not as a separate
  top-level model-visible tool.

`command_run` remains the compact model-visible request shape. It accepts
command items, canonicalizes the command names through
`crates/tools/src/commands` (`canonical_command`), and then executes the
selected `crates/tools/commands/<command>` handler.

`command_run` executes commands in ascending `step` order. Independent
read-only commands in the same step may run concurrently. Mutating commands,
unknown commands, and commands that touch shared workspace files act as
barriers and use the existing command queue and file-lock behavior; new
schedulers or custom lock layers should not be introduced for session/task
work.

Long-running service commands must not be blocking foreground commands. The
`shell_command`, `bash`, and `zsh` command prompts are injected into the `command_run`
description so agents see the same service rule: keep the process handle/PID,
write stdout/stderr logs, poll readiness and process exit together, fail
immediately with exit code and log tail if the service exits before readiness,
and clean up only the started process tree on timeout.

### `crates/router`

Router owns CLI forwarding, agent registration metadata, runtime-worker
dispatch, and runtime-worker lifecycle. It no longer uses ports as the service
boundary.

Router owns:

- Agent registry (agent spec resolution).
- CLI forwarding rules (`POST /run_tool`: resolve a tool binary, forward stdio).
- Runtime-worker dispatch via `POST /run_agent`: agent resolution, worker
  environment contract assembly, and worker subprocess lifecycle.
- Runtime-worker concurrency guards (planning depth and active-worker
  limits, returning `429` on breach).
- Worker status monitoring via `/services/status`.
- Health checks that do not depend on port allocation.

Router does not own command implementation logic, command alias canonicalization
(owned by `crates/tools`), agent loops, prompt assembly, provider request
formatting, provider credentials, shell execution, file locks, or port
allocation. It resolves an agent or tool-binary request to the worker that
should execute it, and it owns lifecycle for any worker needed to serve that
request. Spawning is single-direction: gateway → router → runtime worker.

### `scripts`

Scripts owns setup, startup, install manifests, package environments, and
persistent reusable CLI workflows.

Scripts owns one-click install/start scripts, toolchain verification, frontend
dependency install, Rust dependency fetch/build helpers, Python package
environment manifests, shell/app/module installer manifests, persistent script
manifests, and reusable script entrypoints used by router/tools commands.

## End-To-End Flow

```text
apps/gui or apps/tui
  -> crates/gateway API
  -> gateway session manager
  -> gateway translates request and loads UI/session config
  -> gateway forwards POST /run_agent to crates/router
  -> router resolves agent spec and dispatches a runtime worker
     (the standalone tura_runtime binary, TURA_ROLE=runtime_worker)
  -> crates/runtime (in the worker) starts or resumes session
  -> agents supplies active agent config
  -> crates/runtime builds prompt/context/tool catalog
  -> crates/provider calls selected model
  -> crates/provider normalizes text/tool calls (extract_response_text,
     extract_tool_calls, strip_thought_blocks); runtime consumes ProviderToolCall
  -> crates/runtime (optional) spawns child sub-sessions via
     `tura_router run-agent` CLI subprocess for multi-agent concurrent /
     recursive dispatch (never over HTTP/URL)
  -> crates/tools receives command_run requests
  -> crates/router resolves CLI forwarding and starts managed services when needed
  -> crates/tools/commands executes the selected command handler
  -> crates/runtime stores compact tool results and usage
  -> crates/gateway streams events and replayable state
  -> apps/gui or apps/tui renders rollout, tool state, usage, and final response
```

## Prompt System

Prompt text has three owners:

- Agent prompts: `agents/src/<agent_name>/`, loaded by
  `crates/runtime/src/manas/agent_prompts.rs`.
- Runtime prompt fragments: `crates/runtime/src/prompt_style/`.
- The `command_run` visible tool description:
  `crates/tools/src/command_run/schema.json`, augmented at runtime by
  `crates/runtime/src/manas/tool_catalog.rs`.
- Command prompts: `crates/tools/src/commands/<command>/prompt.md`.

Rules:

- Fixed runtime prompt text belongs in Rust constants under `prompt_style/`.
- Dynamic runtime values are inserted by named builder sections.
- Tool-specific instructions belong near the command.
- Command-specific prompts that affect model behavior through `command_run`
  must be carried through `crates/runtime/src/manas/tool_catalog.rs`; do not
  read prompt files and discard them.
- Agent prompts describe behavior and priorities, not every tool schema detail.
- `command_run` should remain last in the provider tool list for cache
  stability.
- Prompt-cache identity should not include dynamic command-run runtime limits.

## Agent Config

Current `agents` layout:

```text
agents/
  Cargo.toml
  ARCHITECTURE.md
  src/
    lib.rs
    coding_agent.rs
    store.rs
    thoughtful/
      agent_config.json
      prompt.md
    balanced/
      agent_config.json
      prompt.md
    direct/
      agent_config.json
      prompt.md
    direct-text-only/
      agent_config.json
      prompt.md
```

Agent config should define agent id, provider route defaults, stream/tool
choice defaults, enabled command ids, persona bindings, planning defaults, and
validator/final-response policy. The loader scans only `agents/src/<agent_id>`;
root-level `agents/<agent_id>` directories are not read.

Default coding-agent behavior:

- Inspect before editing.
- Prefer compact `command_run` batches for search, reads, shell, tests, and CLI
  calls.
- Put independent read-only work in the same step.
- Put dependent work, edits, and tests in later steps.
- Use `apply_patch` for source edits when available.
- Preserve user changes.
- Run focused checks.
- End with a concise final response.

Command files:

- `mod.rs` or a focused `handler.rs`: argument normalization and high-level
  command handling. Larger commands may keep helper modules under command-local
  `src/` directories.
- `schema.json`: validation and UI/handler matching.
- `prompt.md`: compact model-facing usage guidance.
- `policy.toml`: read/write/network/background/permission policy. Commands may
  add a small `[configurable]` table for bounded non-secret defaults using
  `{ default = "...", enum = ["...", "..."] }`.

Schemas are for validation and handlers. Compact prompts are what should enter
model context.

## Command Run

`command_run` is the default compact visible tool. It wraps command items but no
longer owns the command registry. All registered command names and aliases live
in `crates/router`.

Provider-facing shape:

```json
{
  "step_summary": "Inspect files and run focused checks.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "command_type": "shell_command",
      "step": 1,
      "command_line": "rg \"pattern\" crates/runtime",
      "timeout_secs": 30,
      "env_keys": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Execution rules:

- `step` is optional in the provider-facing schema to match codex-current; the
  handler treats a missing step as the command's original 1-based order.
- Every command item executes with a positive integer `step` after
  normalization.
- Same-step read-only commands may run concurrently as a **macro_command**
  batch. The opt-in is per command handler via the unified trait method
  `supports_macro_command` (formerly `supports_parallel_tool_calls`); the
  command-run router checks it via `tool_supports_macro_command`. The OpenAI
  request field `parallel_tool_calls` is a separate provider-side concept and
  keeps its upstream name.
- Different steps run in ascending order.
- A later step may reference a successful earlier-step result with
  `#@#${<command id or command_type>.<JSON path>}#@#$`. Commands may set an
  `id` to disambiguate repeated command types. Same-step and future-step
  references fail before dispatch.
- Mutating commands need compatible file locks.
- Partial results may be emitted after each step group.
- Agent-visible and persisted command outputs retain their original structure.
  JSON text, fenced JSON, shell `stdout`, and MCP text content are parsed only
  into an in-memory projection used to resolve later-step placeholders.

Built-in command families:

- `shell_command`
- `bash`
- `zsh`
- `apply_patch`
- `read_media`
- `web_discover`
- `task_status`
- `compact_context`
- `planning`

This version exposes console shell commands (`shell_command`, `powershell:*`,
`bash:*`, `zsh:*`, `shell:*`), `apply_patch`, read-only local media inspection,
network-backed web/media discovery, internal task status, and mode-gated
context/task lifecycle commands through `command_run`.

Shell surface selection is controlled by `TURA_COMMAND_RUN_SHELL`. Windows
defaults to PowerShell-backed `shell_command`, macOS defaults to `zsh`, and
other Unix systems default to `bash`. macOS execution prefers the user's
supported shell, then zsh, bash, and sh; `TURA_ZSH_PATH` can point explicit zsh
execution at a custom binary.
Install/start scripts check `shell_command`, `bash`, and `zsh` coverage on all
platforms. Install scripts try to install missing bash/zsh dependencies before
probing coverage: Windows uses MSYS2 via winget/pacman, macOS uses Homebrew,
and Linux uses common system package managers. Start scripts only report
coverage and never install dependencies. `TURA_STRICT_SHELL_TOOL_COVERAGE=1`
turns optional coverage warnings into failures.

`command_type` is the canonical provider-facing command field. Handler input
normalization may accept `command` payloads at the boundary, but prompt and
schema text should use `command_type`.

### Compact Context

`compact_context` is a command-run command used for long coding sessions. It is
injected for coding agents and should be placed in the last step of a batch
when used. The command asks the model for a structured handoff summary covering
current progress, user requirements, relevant files/docs, completed and
remaining work, validation status, and concrete next steps.

After the command completes, runtime:

- removes prior tool-call history from retained context;
- converts the compact summary into the next user-context item;
- preserves the active session and task state machine;
- reinjects the workspace snapshot and recent-file snapshot just like a fresh
  session;
- keeps non-compact commands from the same batch and their outputs in order;
- does not retain raw compact command scaffolding as extra prompt noise.

If estimated context passes the high-water mark, runtime injects a short
continuation prompt asking the agent to compact before continuing. The prompt is
only a trigger; the token savings come from the context-management reset above.

### Media Reading

`read_media` is a read-only command for local images, PDFs, and video metadata
or sampled frames. It returns compact textual observations to the model. Binary
payloads and raw base64 are not kept in retained context; later turns recall the
media through the summarized tool output.

Tools policy configurables are standardized across commands: use a single
`[configurable]` table, one inline table per setting, a `default` string, and an
`enum` string list. `read_media` uses this for media compression, PDF default
page count, directory expansion count, document attachment size, and audio
preview size; `web_discover` uses it for ordered search route fallback.

## File Locks

File locks are owned by `crates/tools/runtime/file_locks`.

Rules:

- Lock keys are canonical workspace-relative paths.
- Reads acquire shared locks.
- Writes acquire exclusive locks.
- Mutating commands such as `apply_patch` declare affected paths before
  execution.
- Unknown mutating shell commands acquire a workspace-wide exclusive lock.
- Locks are acquired in sorted path order.
- Locks are released on success, error, timeout, and cancellation.
- Background commands hold startup locks only unless their manifest declares a
  long-lived write lease.

Command registration records should include command id, aliases, owning crate
path, handler or binary target, CLI argument schema, default timeout, permission
scope, startup mode, health check, restart policy, and stdio strategy. They
should not require port allocation.

Router owns CLI forwarding metadata and lifecycle. The owning crate owns
behavior.

## Adding A Command

1. Create `crates/tools/src/commands/<name>/`.
2. Add Rust handler code, `schema.json`, `prompt.md`, `policy.toml`, and tests.
3. Export the module from `crates/tools/src/commands/mod.rs`.
4. Add `ToolRouter` dispatch when the command should be callable as a direct
   routed tool.
5. Add router aliases, CLI forwarding metadata, and lifecycle metadata in
   `crates/router` only when the command needs router discovery or a managed
   process.
6. Enable it in the target `agents/src/<agent_id>/agent_config.json`.
7. Run focused tools and runtime checks.

## Adding CLI Routing

1. Implement behavior in the owning crate or `crates/tools/commands`.
2. Add command and lifecycle metadata in `crates/router`.
3. Add timeout, health check, restart, and permission/sandbox policy.
4. Add agent command selection in `agents`.
5. Update scripts only when startup/build/install detection changes.

## Workspace Members

Workspace members should follow the current crate layout:

```toml
members = [
  "agents",
  "crates/gateway",
  "crates/provider",
  "crates/router",
  "crates/runtime",
  "crates/tools"
]
```

Package names for those members still follow the Tura package-name table above.

## Runnable Build And Start Paths

Install scripts should keep the Tura-style runnable path:

```text
scripts/build-release.ps1; scripts/register-cli.ps1
scripts/build-release.sh; scripts/register-cli.sh
scripts/start.ps1
scripts/start.sh
```

Core Rust build targets should use package names:

```text
cargo build -p router
cargo build -p gateway
cargo build -p runtime
cargo build -p tools
```

Command-owned dependencies are installed from the command directories, not from
shared script packages:

```text
commands/read_media/install.ps1
commands/read_media/install.sh
commands/web_discover/install.ps1
commands/web_discover/install.sh
```

Playwright support for frontend debugging workflows remains a Bun workspace in
`scripts/packages/playwright_node`.

The normal local path is CLI-driven. Router may start managed local services as
needed, but those services are not addressed through fixed ports:

```text
cargo run -p router --bin tura_router -- forward <command> [args...]
```

Direct package checks should use the same package names as the build targets.

## Focused Build Rules

- `crates/gateway/**`: `cargo fmt -p gateway`, `cargo check -p gateway`.
- `crates/runtime/**`: `cargo fmt -p runtime`,
  `cargo check -p runtime`.
- `agents/**`: `cargo fmt -p agents`,
  `cargo check -p agents`, plus affected agent interface checks.
- `crates/provider/**`: `cargo fmt -p provider`,
  `cargo check -p provider`.
- `crates/tools/**`: `cargo fmt -p tools`, `cargo check -p tools`.
- `crates/router/**`: `cargo fmt -p router`,
  `cargo check -p router`.
- `apps/gui/**`: GUI typecheck/build and focused frontend tests.
- `apps/tui/**`: TUI build and focused CLI/TUI tests.
- `scripts/**`: manifest validation and install dry run when possible.

- `crates/provider/ARCHITECTURE.md`: provider auth, settings, routing, usage,
  and monitoring.
- `crates/tools/ARCHITECTURE.md`: command-run, commands, policies, file locks,
  and output rules.
- `crates/router/ARCHITECTURE.md`: CLI forwarding, command registration,
  lifecycle management, status monitoring, routing metadata, and permission
  forwarding.
- `scripts/ARCHITECTURE.md`: install/start/package/persistent-script rules.
