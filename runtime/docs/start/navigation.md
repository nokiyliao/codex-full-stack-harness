# Documentation navigation

This is the human route through the full documentation set. It mirrors the
GitBook summary and points to the documents that actually own each subject,
rather than sending readers through a corridor of thin placeholder pages.

## Start

1. [Overview](overview.md) - what Tura is and why it exists.
2. [Install](install.md) - source, release, npm, uninstall, and cleanup paths.
3. [Release packages](release-packages.md) - GUI-only installers, full archives, npm packages, and when to use each.
4. [Providers](providers.md) - first-run CLI/TUI/GUI authentication, model selection, routes, and credentials.
5. [How to start](how-to-start.md) - CLI, TUI, GUI, gateway, source starts, and OS PATH requirements.
6. [CLI parameters](cli-parameters.md) - command-line options, binaries, and environment flags.
7. [Settings](settings.md) - settings map with links to TUI, GUI, providers, sessions, and CLI options.
8. [Sessions](sessions.md) - durable workspace-scoped session history.

## Core

1. [Task status](../core/task-status.md) - structured task state, task types, completion gates, and compact handoff state.
2. [Context management](../core/context-management.md) - session records, compaction, prompt reinsertion, and long-task continuity.
3. [Runtime prompt](../core/runtime-prompt.md) - operation manuals selected by `task_type`.
4. [Command run](../core/command-run.md) - batched shell, patch, web/media, and task-state command execution.
5. [Commands](../core/commands.md) - command registry, schemas, policies, and command implementation rules.
6. [Agents](../core/agents.md) - agent identities, capabilities, prompt resources, aliases, and model defaults.
7. [Personas](../core/personas.md) - communication style, persona prompt fragments, display metadata, and media expressions.
8. [Rich text](../core/html-rich-text.md) - messaging-app HTML subset, media tokens, and GUI/TUI rendering behavior.
9. [Dynamic prompt injection](../core/prompt-style.md) - runtime-owned prompt fragments for state, persona, task, retry, and compaction.

## Architecture

1. [Session DB](../../crates/session_log/ARCHITECTURE.md) - SQLite owner, workspace session logs, indexes, queues, and sockets.
2. [Gateway](../../crates/gateway/ARCHITECTURE.md) - HTTP/SSE API, config, sessions, provider, file, and GUI-serving surface.
3. [Router](../../crates/router/ARCHITECTURE.md) - per-home daemon, runtime dispatch, registry operations, and IPC routing.
4. [Runtime](../../crates/runtime/ARCHITECTURE.md) - agent loop, context building, provider streaming, tool callbacks, manuals, and checkpoints.
5. [Tool](../../crates/tools/ARCHITECTURE.md) - tool contracts, command-run execution, policies, locks, cancellation, and output shaping.
6. [Terminal user interface](../../apps/tui/ARCHITECTURE.md) - TypeScript terminal client, CLI flows, rendering, and gateway interaction.
7. [Graphic user interface](../../apps/gui/ARCHITECTURE.md) - Solid/Vite GUI architecture, workspace UI, settings, sessions, and gateway usage.

## Customization

1. [Custom providers](../customization/custom-providers.md) - release/source provider config, auth, model routes, and validation.
2. [Custom personas](../customization/custom-personas.md) - release/source persona files, prompt fragments, and media manifests.
3. [Custom agents](../customization/custom-agents.md) - release/source agent definitions, capabilities, prompts, and aliases.
4. [Custom runtime prompt](../customization/custom-runtime-prompt.md) - manual catalogs, `task_type`, dependencies, and capability injection.
5. [Custom commands](../customization/custom-commands.md) - command handlers, schemas, policies, prompts, tests, and agent exposure.

## Development

1. [Scripts](../../scripts/ARCHITECTURE.md) - installers, debug/release builds, CLI registration, CI, release packaging, and npm packaging.
2. [Testing](../../scripts/ARCHITECTURE.md#xtask-test-collection-scripts) - business, OS, live, release, performance, app, and benchmark test lanes.
3. [Environment](settings.md) - operational settings and environment references for providers, sessions, CLI, and clients.
4. [Architecture](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) - whole-project binary topology, repository layout, logs, services, and ownership.
5. [Benchmark methodology](https://github.com/Tura-AI/benchmark/blob/main/doc/benchmark-methodology.md) - benchmark scope, task selection, scoring, and limitations.
6. [Current test-set evidence record](https://github.com/Tura-AI/benchmark/blob/main/doc/current-test-set-record.md) - data lineage, cohort boundaries, retained anomalies, design observations, and limitations.
7. [Benchmark repository](https://github.com/Tura-AI/benchmark) - task declarations, agent launch config, reports, and harnesses.
