# Install and Uninstall

This page covers the full local lifecycle: install Tura from the source
repository, run the GitHub-hosted installer with `curl`, unregister or remove a
local installation, and clean local runtime state when you genuinely need a
fresh environment. Installation is already enough of an adventure; the map
should not add one.

For prebuilt GUI-only installers, complete release archives, and npm package
differences, see [Release packages](release-packages.md).

Tura is built from the repository. The dependency installers in `scripts/` are
not standalone package managers: they expect to run from a Tura checkout so they
can find `commands/`, `apps/`, `crates/`, and release scripts.

## Requirements

The source installer checks these tools and installs the missing ones when the
current platform has a supported installer. In `CheckOnly` or `Offline` mode it
only verifies them and fails with the manual step needed.

| Tool                 | Required for                              | Notes                                                                                                                                                             |

The source install scripts check Git, Rust/Cargo, PowerShell, `shell_command`,
`bash`, `zsh`, Bun, uv, and Python 3.12 coverage. They update PATH for the
current process, GitHub Actions, and user-local tool locations where the platform
supports safe user PATH/profile updates. The npm package postinstall is narrower:
it installs or copies release binaries, registers the Tura CLI path, and checks
only runtime dependencies such as PowerShell on Windows and basic shell/archive
tools on Unix. It does not check or install Rust/Cargo, Bun, uv, or Python.
Set `TURA_STRICT_SHELL_TOOL_COVERAGE=1` if you want missing optional shell
surfaces to fail instead of warn.

## Install from a Git checkout

Clone the repository and run the platform installer from the checkout root.

### Contributor dependency setup

If you are preparing a checkout for development or tests, start with
environment-only mode. It installs or verifies dependencies without building a
release and without modifying your user PATH:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Tura-AI/tura.git
cd tura
.\scripts\install.ps1 -EnvironmentOnly
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tura-AI/tura.git
cd tura
./scripts/install.sh --environment-only
```

### Full source installation

Use the default installer when you want a runnable release command registered
for future terminals:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Tura-AI/tura.git
cd tura
.\scripts\install.ps1
tura
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tura-AI/tura.git
cd tura
./scripts/install.sh
tura
```

The final `tura` command opens the TUI; it does not send a model request. The
installer does not provide an API key, token, or subscription login. Before the
first prompt, follow [Provider setup](providers.md#first-run-configure-an-llm-provider)
to authenticate a provider and select one of its models.

By default, `scripts/install.*` installs source-checkout dependencies, builds the
full release into `target/release`, and registers that directory on the user
PATH. `scripts/build-release.*` and `scripts/register-cli.*` remain available
for targeted development and release work.

The PATH change is user-scoped. On Windows, the installer adds the checkout's
`target\release` directory to the user PATH. On Linux, it adds a marked block to
existing `.profile`, `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `.zprofile`, or `.zshrc` files
and ensures `.profile` exists. On macOS, it also ensures `.zprofile` and `.zshrc`
exist. It does not overwrite unrelated entries, but the new entry can take
precedence over another `tura` executable. PATH registration itself does not
require administrator privileges; dependency package managers may separately
request elevation.

Use `scripts/unregister-cli.*` to remove the registered release path. The command
does not delete the checkout, release files, provider data, or session data.

## Install with curl from GitHub

Use this when you want a single terminal flow that downloads the source archive
from GitHub and runs the repository installer. It uses the public
`https://github.com/Tura-AI/tura` repository as the source.

### Linux and macOS

```bash
set -eu
curl -L https://github.com/Tura-AI/tura/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz -o tura-main.tar.gz
mkdir -p tura-install
tar -xzf tura-main.tar.gz -C tura-install --strip-components=1
cd tura-install
./scripts/install.sh
tura
```

If you already have a checkout and only want to run the GitHub-hosted install
file, download the installer into that checkout before executing it:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tura-AI/tura/main/scripts/install.sh -o scripts/install.sh
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

Do not pipe the installer directly into `sh`: the script resolves paths relative
to its own file location and expects the rest of the repository to be present.
Piping loses that context. Tiny detail, large faceplant.

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
curl.exe -L "https://github.com/Tura-AI/tura/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" -o "tura-main.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "tura-main.zip" -DestinationPath "tura-main-expanded" -Force
$repo = Get-ChildItem -Path "tura-main-expanded" -Directory | Select-Object -First 1
Set-Location $repo.FullName
.\scripts\install.ps1
tura
```

If you already have a checkout and only want the GitHub-hosted install file:

```powershell
curl.exe -L "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tura-AI/tura/main/scripts/install.ps1" -o "scripts\install.ps1"
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install.ps1
```

## Installer options

Only `-EnvironmentOnly` or `--environment-only` changes the installer into a
dependency-only flow. Dependency-only switches must be paired with that option.

| PowerShell         | Bash                 | Meaning                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-EnvironmentOnly` | `--environment-only` | Install or verify dependencies only; skip release build and PATH registration. |
| `-SkipCommands`    | `--skip-commands`    | Skip `commands/*/install.*` command package setup.                             |
| `-SkipApps`        | `--skip-apps`        | Skip JavaScript installs for TUI, GUI, and Tauri workspaces.                   |
| `-SkipUv`          | `--skip-uv`          | Do not install or verify uv. Requires skipping command installers.             |
| `-SkipBun`         | `--skip-bun`         | Do not install or verify Bun. Requires skipping app installers.                |
| `-CheckOnly`       | `--check-only`       | Verify expected tools and environments without installing.                     |
| `-Offline`         | `--offline`          | Use offline or cache-only flags where supported.                               |

Examples:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1 -EnvironmentOnly -CheckOnly
.\scripts\install.ps1 -EnvironmentOnly -SkipApps
```

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --environment-only --check-only
./scripts/install.sh --environment-only --skip-apps
```

## Build options

The normal release build includes backend binaries, the TUI executable, the GUI
web dist, the Tauri desktop bundle, provider config, prompts, command metadata,
and command source files.

```powershell
.\scripts\build-release.ps1
```

```bash
./scripts/build-release.sh
```

Useful build switches:

| PowerShell     | Bash                  | Meaning                                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-BackendOnly` | `--backend-only`      | Build Rust backend release artifacts only.                        |
| `-Binary`      | `--binary`            | Keep only binaries and minimal provider config in release output. |
| `-SkipTui`     | `--skip-tui`          | Skip the compiled TUI executable.                                 |
| `-SkipGui`     | `--skip-gui`          | Skip the GUI web build.                                           |
| `-SkipTauri`   | `--skip-tauri`        | Skip the Tauri desktop bundle.                                    |
| `-Clean`       | `-clean` or `--clean` | Remove repository-local runtime state before building.            |

## Verify the install

After registration, open a new terminal and verify that the executable starts:

```powershell
tura --help
tura
```

```bash
tura --help
tura
```

`tura --help` verifies the installation without calling a provider. Running
`tura` opens the TUI, where an installation with no configured LLM provider is
sent to Provider settings. A successful model prompt is a provider check, not an
installation check; complete [Provider setup](providers.md#first-run-configure-an-llm-provider)
first.

For a local dependency-only check without changing the build output:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1 -EnvironmentOnly -CheckOnly
```

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --environment-only --check-only
```

## Uninstall the CLI registration

Unregistering removes Tura release PATH entries and stale `cli-bin` wrappers. It
does not delete the checkout, build artifacts, provider logs, or session data.

```powershell
.\scripts\unregister-cli.ps1
```

```bash
./scripts/unregister-cli.sh
```

Open a new terminal after unregistering so the shell reloads PATH.

## Remove local files

After unregistering, delete the checkout directory if you want to remove the
source tree and build artifacts:

```powershell
Set-Location ..
Remove-Item -LiteralPath .\tura -Recurse -Force
```

```bash
cd ..
rm -rf ./tura
```

Only run those commands from the parent directory of the checkout you intend to
delete. Obvious, yes. Still where people lose afternoons.

## Clean local runtime state

Tura stores runtime and session state in two places:

| Location                                   | Contents                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<TURA_HOME>/db/session_log/index.sqlite3` | per-home session DB index and queue                             |
| `<TURA_HOME>/.tura/`                       | sockets, locks, active gateway file, and per-home runtime state |
| `<workspace>/.tura/session_log.sqlite3`    | workspace session history                                       |
| `<workspace>/.tura/config.conf`            | workspace settings                                              |
| `log/provider/YYYY-MM-DD/*.json`           | provider request and response diagnostics                       |

When `TURA_HOME` is not set and you run from the source checkout, the checkout
itself is the instance home. The release build cleanup switch removes only these
repository-local runtime files before building:

```text
db/session_log
.tura/config.conf
.tura/session_log.sqlite3
.tura/session_log.sqlite3-wal
.tura/session_log.sqlite3-shm
.tura/session_log.sqlite3.init.lock
```

Run the cleanup build like this:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-release.ps1 -Clean
```

```bash
./scripts/build-release.sh --clean
```

Use `-Clean` or `--clean` when you need a fresh local runtime state before a
release build. Do not use it if you need to preserve local sessions or workspace
settings.

## Manual environment cleanup

If you want to clean a custom `TURA_HOME`, stop Tura processes first, then remove
only the home you explicitly selected.

PowerShell example:

```powershell
$env:TURA_HOME = "C:\Users\you\tura-home"
Get-Process tura,tura_gateway,tura_router,tura_session_db,tura_runtime,tura_exec -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
  Stop-Process -Force
Remove-Item -LiteralPath $env:TURA_HOME -Recurse -Force
```

Bash example:

```bash
export TURA_HOME="$HOME/tura-home"
pkill -f "$TURA_HOME" || true
rm -rf -- "$TURA_HOME"
```

For workspace-only cleanup, remove the workspace `.tura` directory after
confirming you no longer need its session history or settings:

```powershell
Remove-Item -LiteralPath .\.tura -Recurse -Force
```

```bash
rm -rf -- ./.tura
```

Provider logs are separate from session history. Remove `log/provider/` only if
you no longer need request diagnostics.

## Update an existing checkout

```powershell
git pull
.\scripts\install.ps1
```

```bash
git pull
./scripts/install.sh
```

Use the cleanup build switch during update only when you intentionally want to
drop repository-local runtime state.
