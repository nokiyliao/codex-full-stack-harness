# We Need More Benchmark Data and Test Reports

Tura has benchmark results I am happy to publish. It also has a much larger pile of questions those results do not answer.

Both statements can be true.

The current evidence is useful. Across the published DeepSWE runs, the same 20 tasks were repeated three times for Tura Balanced, Tura Direct, and Codex CLI. There are also rewrite tasks and separately reviewed design tasks, with prompts, tool calls, token usage, patches, and verifier results archived in the benchmark repository.

That is real evidence, not a screenshot with a number floating above it. It tells us something about those named configurations on those tasks.

It does not tell us that Tura wins with every model, every reasoning level, every provider, every repository, or every operating system. It does not tell us which Tura feature caused how much of the result. And it says very little about whether the GUI stays responsive after six hours on a machine I do not own.

So the next useful contribution may not be another feature. It may be a careful test report.

## The current benchmark is a starting point

The headline results are easy to repeat: in the published comparison, Direct used fewer aggregate tokens than Codex CLI at a comparable verifier success rate, while Balanced spent more of the saved budget on investigation and verification and reached a higher success rate on the tested set.

The important words are "published comparison" and "tested set."

Most of the long-horizon evidence is currently centered on GPT-5.6 SOL and Codex/OpenAI-style configurations. The repository contains fixtures and configuration for more provider families, but a configuration file is not a benchmark result. A mocked request is not proof that a real provider streams, retries, reports usage, and handles tool calls correctly under a long job.

The complete current scope is recorded in the benchmark repository's [current test-set record](https://github.com/Tura-AI/benchmark/blob/main/doc/current-test-set-record.md). The rules used to produce and judge those runs are in the full [benchmark methodology](https://github.com/Tura-AI/benchmark/blob/main/doc/benchmark-methodology.md).

I trust the current results within that boundary. I do not want to quietly move the boundary after reading the result.

## We need a matrix, not one taller leaderboard

Running more tasks is useful, but task count is only one axis. Coding-agent performance is a product of at least the model, reasoning setting, provider protocol, harness, task, environment, and budget. Change several at once and the final score may be interesting, but it becomes difficult to explain.

The comparison I want to see crosses three large dimensions.

### More reasoning levels and models

The same model can behave very differently across reasoning levels, and different models can behave differently at the same named level. They may vary in tool calls, token use, investigation depth, latency, and correctness.

We should run matched tasks across every supported reasoning level for more than one model family while keeping the agent architecture, provider protocol, timeout, task revision, and evaluation fixed. Record the exact model version and effective reasoning parameter, and do not assume that similarly named settings from different models are equivalent.

A repeated model-by-reasoning-level matrix with variance is more useful than a single high-versus-medium result.

### More model providers

Tura needs repeated long-horizon runs for Anthropic/Claude, Google/Gemini, at least one OpenAI-compatible third party, and a local endpoint when hardware permits. Those runs should record exact model versions, dates, settings, cost, failures, and raw sanitized artifacts.

This is not only a leaderboard question. Providers disagree in the details: streaming events, parallel tool calls, reasoning metadata, prompt caching, usage accounting, retries, cancellation, and malformed responses. An agent can look excellent against a fixture and still fail because one live stream ends differently.

Cost matters here too. Live matrices can become expensive quickly. A sensible sequence is protocol fixtures first, cost-bounded smoke tests second, and repeated long-horizon runs only where the earlier layers are stable.

The provider gap and the evidence needed to close it are documented in [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](https://github.com/Tura-AI/tura/blob/main/docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md#provider-and-reasoning-level-benchmark-coverage-is-narrow).

### More agent architectures

Comparing Tura only with one CLI would tell us too little. We need agents with materially different execution designs: typed micro-tools, a bash-only harness, macro execution, planner-and-executor systems, and multi-agent or delegated workflows where a reproducible public configuration exists.

The hard part is fairness. "Same model" is not enough if one agent gets a different reasoning budget, hidden system prompt, timeout, retry policy, or task patch. Each report should identify the agent version, public configuration, tool surface, model settings, task revision, limits, and scoring path.

I am less interested in manufacturing a universal winner than in learning where each architecture bends. Maybe macro execution helps most on tool-heavy repair work. Maybe another design is better for short edits. Maybe the ranking changes completely with a different provider. Those are useful answers.

## We need to ablate Tura itself

The current results compare complete configurations. They do not prove that one named feature caused the difference.

The project README is explicit about this: there is currently no ablation proving that `command_run` alone causes the lower turn and token usage. That caveat should become an experiment, not slowly disappear from the story.

Useful Tura ablations include:

- Tura with `command_run` enabled versus Tura with it disabled and equivalent commands executed through single-action model turns;
- the original mini-swe-agent versus a mini-swe-agent fork with the same `command_run` contract, permissions, and command set;
- task-specific operation manuals versus the same agent without those runtime instructions;
- backward-reasoning guidance versus a matched general engineering prompt;
- structured compact-context checkpoints versus ordinary transcript summarization on long sessions;
- explicit durable task state versus chat-only continuation after interruption;
- Direct and Balanced components separated one at a time, rather than treating two full presets as a clean causal comparison.

The two `command_run` experiments test the same feature from opposite directions: remove it from Tura, then add it to mini-swe-agent and compare the fork with the original. If both comparisons move in the same direction under matched conditions, the causal case is stronger.

Each ablation should change one thing, keep the rest fixed, repeat enough times to show variance, and report correctness as well as tokens, turns, latency, and cost. If disabling a feature saves tokens but breaks more tasks, that is not a free improvement. If a feature helps only after context grows past a certain size, that boundary is more useful than one aggregate average.

Some of these experiments will be awkward to build. Good. If a feature cannot be isolated, we should be cautious about assigning it a percentage of the credit.

## One benchmark case I would like to see

Here is a concrete example. Take a small fixed set of long-horizon repair tasks and run the same model and reasoning level through four cells:

| Cell | Agent setup | What it helps isolate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Tura with `command_run` enabled | Tura's full macro-execution path |
| B | Tura with `command_run` disabled | The effect of removing macro execution from Tura |
| C | Original mini-swe-agent | The external baseline without macro execution |
| D | mini-swe-agent with the same `command_run` contract | The effect of adding macro execution outside Tura |

Keep the task revisions, model version, reasoning level, provider, permissions, timeout, machine, evaluation, and run count fixed. Repeat each cell at least three times. Record verifier success, turns, input and output tokens, wall time, cost, failures, and the raw run artifacts.

Run the same four-cell comparison across additional reasoning levels and models only after the fixed-model experiment is stable. This separates the effect of `command_run` from interactions with model capability and inference budget.

This is only one useful case. A provider matrix, a GUI memory-growth report, or a Windows process-cleanup failure can be equally valuable. If you have only one cell, one task, or one failed run, send that too. Partial evidence is how a complete benchmark often begins.

## Tell me your benchmark case

I do not assume that I understand every area of programming. I understand even less about the full range of work in other industries. That limits the benchmark cases I can design on my own: I may know how to make a task reproducible without knowing whether it represents the difficult part of your actual work.

I have used Tura to process photos and edit video, but those uses are not yet formal benchmarks. Someone who works deeply in imaging, video production, data engineering, scientific computing, security, finance, embedded systems, game development, or another domain may have a much clearer idea of which tasks would test useful capability rather than generic tool use.

Tell me the benchmark case you think is missing. Describe the real task, the input materials, the constraints, what a correct result looks like, which failures matter, and what can be shared publicly. A useful case does not need to be large. It needs a stable task, a checkable outcome, and enough domain context to distinguish a correct solution from a plausible-looking one.

If the task depends on private data, licensed media, specialized hardware, paid software, or professional judgment, say so. We can look for a public fixture, a smaller reproducible version, or an evaluation protocol that preserves the important constraint without publishing material that should remain private.

## Agent benchmarks do not test the whole product

A coding benchmark can finish with a correct patch while the local product still leaks memory, loses a session, hangs during shutdown, or renders a transcript badly. The verifier does not care. The user does.

Tura already has backend, GUI, TUI, performance, OS, release, and live test suites. That does not make those surfaces finished. It gives us somewhere to put the next regression.

For the TUI, we need broader measurements for startup, first render, keystroke latency, stream updates, resizing, session switching, memory growth, large tool output, Unicode, concurrent sessions, and resumed histories across representative terminals.

For the GUI and packaged desktop app, we need repeatable reports for startup, long transcripts, streamed rich text, session switching, plan scale, calendar navigation, DOM growth, memory retention, dropped updates, and differences between browser and desktop webviews.

A frontend report should include behavior correctness, not only timing. A fast blank transcript is technically fast and otherwise unhelpful.

The open TUI and GUI baselines are listed in the complete [Known Issues and Evidence Gaps](https://github.com/Tura-AI/tura/blob/main/docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) document.

## The operating system always gets a vote

Tura manages processes, sockets, file locks, shell profiles, PATH entries, local databases, desktop dependencies, and child-process cleanup. These are exactly the things that look portable until they meet a second operating system.

The source installer already runs in CI on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows Server 2022, and Windows Server 2025. That is valuable coverage. It is not the end of the story.

We still need lifecycle and soak reports around signals, process trees, antivirus delays, permissions, path separators, spaces and Unicode in paths, sleep and resume, abrupt process death, queue recovery, repeated restart, and old session data. Linux, macOS, and Windows each have their own way of making a reasonable process assumption look naive.

When you find one of these failures, please keep the ugly details. The exact OS version, shell, filesystem path, command, exit code, and relevant log tail are often the difference between a fix and a ghost story.

## What a useful report can look like

You do not need to produce a paper, and you do not need to make every submission conform 100% to the benchmark contract or report schema. Those contracts matter when we turn a result into a reproducible public claim or merge it as a canonical benchmark artifact. They are not a ticket you must present before telling us something useful.

You can send raw output. You can send one failed run. You can describe a benchmark case you think we should add. You can report a bug without knowing its root cause. You can also send an unfinished idea or simply tell us that a workflow felt wrong. Please label what you know, what you do not know, and whether the material has been sanitized. We can help turn a promising observation into a structured case later.

When you do have enough information for a reproducible benchmark or test report, the following details make it much easier for another person to check:

For a benchmark or test report, include:

- the Tura commit and agent configuration;
- the model, provider, model version, reasoning level, and date;
- the operating system, hardware, shell, and relevant runtime versions;
- the exact command, workload, timeout, warm-up policy, and sample count;
- expected behavior and observed behavior;
- correctness results alongside latency, token, memory, or cost measurements;
- failures, retries, timeouts, and any excluded observation;
- sanitized raw output or a small reproducible fixture;
- what was not tested.

Do not publish API keys, OAuth material, cookies, authorization headers, private prompts, session content, or personal filesystem paths. "Raw data" means enough data to recompute the result, not a ceremonial dumping of secrets.

The repository's complete format for performance evidence and sanitization is in [docs/contributing-guide.md](https://github.com/Tura-AI/tura/blob/main/docs/contributing-guide.md#performance-and-efficiency-evidence). Use it when you are making a formal performance claim or preparing a canonical artifact; do not treat it as a reason to withhold an early result. General test ownership and entrypoints are in [tests/README.md](https://github.com/Tura-AI/tura/blob/main/tests/README.md).

Negative results are welcome. If a comparison shows no meaningful difference, that saves someone else from building a claim around noise. If Tura loses badly on a model or OS, that is not disloyal data. It is a map.

## Tura is not mature

There are parts of Tura I use and believe in. There are also unfinished product paths, narrow evidence, provider gaps, frontend baselines we have not established, and OS behavior that needs more hostile testing.

Calling it mature would make the project sound safer for about five minutes and make it harder to improve for much longer.

I believe Tura will change how later coding agents are architected. Macro execution reduces unnecessary model round trips. Explicit task state makes long work less dependent on a chat transcript. Runtime-selected instructions avoid loading every rule into every task. Durable sessions and a shared backend let different frontends continue the same work instead of creating parallel agents.

That is a design argument and a personal conviction. It is not yet a universal empirical result.

The way to make the argument stronger is not to repeat it louder. It is to test Tura with more models, more reasoning levels, more providers, more agent architectures, cleaner ablations, more frontends, and more operating systems—and to publish the runs that surprise us.

## Send me what you find

Formal GitHub [issues](https://github.com/Tura-AI/tura/issues) are welcome. They are the best place for a reproducible bug, a proposal that needs discussion, or a report with artifacts we should track to completion.

But an issue is not the only door. You do not have to wait until you have a polished benchmark report or a schema-complete submission. If Tura behaves strangely, performs unexpectedly well, loses badly, breaks on your operating system, or simply makes a workflow more annoying than it should be, share it on any social platform and mention `@tura-ai-agent` or use `#tura-ai-agent`.

I watch both. Write down your comment in plain language and include whatever you have: an idea, a screenshot, raw output, a command, an error message, or just the situation that felt wrong. They give me a practical way to find feedback outside the repository and turn an isolated observation into a reproducible issue, a test, or a better benchmark case.

The goal is ambitious: I want to make Tura the strongest-performing open-source coding agent.

We will not get there by calling it the strongest before the evidence exists. We get there by collecting honest reports, testing the architecture from angles I have missed, and improving the parts that fail in public.
