# OS Testing

`tests/os_testing/` contains the local tests that are allowed to own backend
processes, sockets, locks, service lifecycles, shutdown behavior, or cross-OS
policy. They are gated by `os-tests` and run serially. Parallelism is lovely
until two tests both believe they own the same daemon.

Use this category for router/session_db ownership, gateway front leases,
runtime worker lifecycle, command_run process-tree cleanup, and OS policy
matrix coverage. Session_db or router stress tests that open IPC services or
local sockets also belong here so they run serially. Keep ordinary business
behavior in `tests/business/`; process ownership is not an ordinary business
detail.

```powershell
.\xtask\scripts\run-backend-os-tests.ps1 -List
.\xtask\scripts\run-backend-os-tests.ps1
.\tests\os_testing\local\run-windows.ps1 -List
.\tests\os_testing\local\run-install-release-windows.ps1
```

```bash
sh xtask/scripts/run-backend-os-tests.sh --list
sh xtask/scripts/run-backend-os-tests.sh
sh tests/os_testing/local/run-linux.sh --list
sh tests/os_testing/local/run-macos.sh --list
sh tests/os_testing/local/run-install-release-linux.sh
sh tests/os_testing/local/run-install-release-macos.sh
```

GitHub Actions uses the matching `tests/os_testing/actions/run-*.{sh,ps1}` and
`run-install-release-*.{sh,ps1}` wrappers so the four OS runners share the same
install, release, and backend OS test contracts while still keeping OS-specific
entrypoints explicit. The runner-label wrappers are `run-ubuntu-latest.sh`,
`run-macos-latest.sh`, `run-windows-2022.ps1`, and `run-windows-2025.ps1`, with
matching `run-install-release-*` wrappers.

On Windows, each backend OS target has a bounded timeout. Assertion failures
retain their nonzero exit code and diagnostics, while timeout and failure paths
terminate the Cargo process tree and any repo-owned backend child processes
started by the runner. Run `scripts/tests/scripts/test-backend-os-runner.ps1`
to verify both assertion and timeout cleanup without running the real suite.

The required source installer contract is additionally covered by
`.github/workflows/source-install.yml`: the default installer must complete
environment setup, release build, PATH registration, and `tura --help` discovery
from a fresh shell on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows Server 2022, and Windows Server
2025. The wrappers above retain targeted release and lifecycle coverage.

To conserve Actions quota while debugging, target the OS workflow before running
the final matrix. Push a `codex/**` branch or commit message containing
`os-install`, `os-backend`, `os-tui`, or `os-full`; add `windows`,
`windows-2022`, `windows-2025`, `linux`, or `macos` to narrow the runner set.
Final validation should use `os-full` so install-release, backend OS, and TUI
lifecycle all run.
