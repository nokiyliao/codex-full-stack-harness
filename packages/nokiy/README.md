`codex-collaboration-harness` is a small, domain-neutral Python reference
implementation for coordinating delegated agent work without transferring the
parent mission to a worker.

The harness models one closed collaboration cycle:

```text
mission -> first false predicate -> bounded task packet -> lease/CAS claim
        -> step/effect ledger -> execution result -> terminal receipt
        -> destination-bound callback with delivery reconciliation
        -> convergence proof -> mission verification or route selection
```

It is intentionally an in-memory reference, not an agent runtime, workflow
service, sandbox, durable queue, or authorization system. Integrators provide
the actual worker, persistence, effect, and callback adapters.

The `$tura-kernel` Skill and its implicit Native-versus-graph selection path are
retired. They did not reproduce the external runtime's model-loop,
context, or provider gains because those surfaces remained owned by Native
Codex. The parent may still create a first-class Native Codex task from a
verified capsule, but its prompt no longer invokes or installs a Skill. See
[`docs/nokiy-kernel-retirement.md`](docs/nokiy-kernel-retirement.md).

Ordinary Native task dispatch can inherit the current Native Codex model and
reasoning setting, or request a `preferred` pair for its first turn without
binding later turns to it. Explicit benchmark or reproduction profiles may pin
both values; `thinking="max"` is their default and highest admitted Nokiy effort.
The capsule renderer does not advertise `ultra` as a Nokiy tier.

The package also retains an optional, transport-neutral
[`NokiyAdapter`](src/codex_collaboration_harness/adapters/nokiy.py). It turns the
generic task/lease contract into a bounded Nokiy request and maps a third-party
Nokiy terminal envelope back into the core result/failure model. No private
endpoint, credential, UTM shape, or Nokiy runtime source is required by the
Python package.

For an explicitly selected `direct` or `balanced` turn, `nokiy-embedded-run`
verifies an exact frozen runtime image, starts execution-local Router and
Session DB processes, and returns a terminal result. The default single-task
path uses the existing native worker and command graph without those services.
Neither path reads or writes the private Codex session database. See
[`docs/embedded-nokiy-runtime.md`](docs/embedded-nokiy-runtime.md).

For review of the historical external-runtime profile, the repository binds the
[public AGPL runtime fork](https://github.com/nokiyliao/tura)
through [`components/nokiy-runtime.json`](components/nokiy-runtime.json). The
manifest deliberately separates the public source ref, the benchmarked
candidate, and any installed/running claim. See
[`docs/full-stack-profile.md`](docs/full-stack-profile.md).

### nokiy Naming

Owned CLI entry points are `nokiy-taskpacket`, `nokiy-graph-tool`, and
`nokiy-embedded-run`; Python modules are `native_nokiy`, `embedded_nokiy`, and
`adapters.nokiy`. Importers must adopt these names when installing this candidate.
The command-graph MCP tools are `nokiy_graph_prepare` and `nokiy_graph_execute`.
This source rename does not switch any installed caller or running runtime.

Durable request IDs, callback markers, wire schemas, existing recovery paths,
and external binary/environment contracts retain their exact values. They are
not branding. Historical records and golden identity vectors are not rewritten.
Upstream source and license provenance remain in [provenance](docs/provenance.md)
and the component manifest; the name does not claim an independent engine rewrite.

## Why It Exists

Agent collaboration often treats a completed child task as proof that the
parent goal is complete. That shortcut loses mission ownership, makes retries
ambiguous, and can duplicate effects. This project makes the missing control
edges explicit and testable:

- the parent owns an ordered list of measurable exit predicates;
- only the first false predicate is eligible for work;
- a task packet carries a bounded route and abandon condition;
- a lease and compare-and-swap version protect the declared scope;
- a worker result is converted into a typed terminal receipt that releases the
  exact task lease;
- an unsettled effect can be reconciled on the same attempt without executing
  the worker again;
- typed blockers can receive model-generated recovery proposals, but a
  deterministic gate enforces the parent packet's scope, authority, effect,
  destination, predicate, verification plan, and recovery budget;
- continuation targets an exact destination and request identity; a delivery
  that may have committed cannot retry until an authoritative absence or
  convergence proof reconciles that same request;
- callback, receipt, and continuation ACK identities are created only after
  convergence;
- every mission verification consumes a complete parent snapshot with a
  monotonic state sequence, so older truth cannot overwrite newer truth;
- route disposition and supersession remain parent-authored evidence rather
  than worker authority;
- control returns to parent mission verification or route selection.

## Quick Start

Requirements: Python 3.11 or newer. Runtime code uses only the Python standard
library.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nokiyliao/codex-collaboration-harness.git
cd codex-collaboration-harness
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The test suite is the canonical executable contract. It includes a deterministic
in-memory end-to-end cycle and negative or recovery cases for stale mission/CAS
state, duplicate dispatch, overlapping leases, pre-execution rejection,
unsettled effects, callback mismatch/reconciliation, stale parent snapshots,
bounded recovery, route disposition, missing convergence, and replay. It
uses no network, credentials, private corpus, or external agent service.

Run only the complete public cycle with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest \
  tests.test_harness.HappyPathTests.test_complete_cycle -v
```

Until a release is installed, the source-tree equivalent is:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

There is no runtime daemon or lifecycle service in the reference package. The
`nokiy-taskpacket` CLI validates and renders an immutable Native task capsule.
Its `--format dispatch` view is a compact
ready-to-send Native task with task-local evidence already projected; it does
not create sessions, dispatch workers, or write callbacks. A target-bound
capsule can be compiled into exact official `create_thread` arguments with:

```bash
nokiy-taskpacket prepare-dispatch --task-name /root/example_task
```

The resulting dispatch-plan v5 JSON binds the selection policy, target, prompt
digest, callback identity, and parent thread without a Skill contract. A
`preferred` profile supplies initial model and reasoning arguments while
allowing later official Native turns to override them. A pinned profile binds
the exact pair for reproducibility; an inherited profile omits both from
`create_thread` so Native Codex selects them. It also
reports exact UTF-8 byte counts for the dispatch, projected task context, and
J-Space policy plus the inline evidence-reference count. The Commander still
performs the official task creation. `install-skill` is no longer exposed.

Audit an existing packet root without migrating or dispatching anything with:

```bash
nokiy-taskpacket inspect-packets
```

Preflight or execute one explicit full Nokiy runtime call with:

```bash
nokiy-embedded-run preflight --request /absolute/path/request.json
nokiy-embedded-run run --request /absolute/path/request.json
```

`read-result` retrieves an existing terminal independently of expired execution
context. Detailed traces stay in the request's local artifact root; only the
bounded result and exact artifact identities belong in the Native conversation.
Version 3 requests bind the result to the current Native `CODEX_THREAD_ID` and
declare Codex as the sole durable session owner. They can also require
authoritative tool-loop evidence, so a model's textual claim cannot turn a
tool-free response into a successful execution.

The inventory separates current target-bound packets from readable historical
packets and exact rejected members. Historical digest-only v1 filenames remain
readable, but they still fail `prepare-dispatch` because they have no execution
profile. Add `--summary` when only the counts, total, root, and full inventory
digest are needed; this avoids carrying the per-packet rows into a callback turn.

Capsules whose scopes are all explicitly prefixed with `read:` receive the
`NATIVE_TURA_READ_ONLY_FAST_PATH_V1` and
`NATIVE_TURA_FAST_PATH_EXECUTION_V3` markers. The inline fast-path contract is
self-contained, so those tasks do not spend a Native tool continuation loading
an external policy file. They obtain
`CODEX_THREAD_ID` in the same first batch as every task read, proceed directly
to the single terminal callback, and emit only a fixed delivery acknowledgement
after tool success. The compiler embeds the exact two-line canonical terminal
template so the worker cannot drift to a historical marker while source/test
discovery is disabled. The fast-path command contract also avoids zsh
special-parameter collisions and requires hidden-root-aware file enumeration.
The terminal marker plus canonical JSON is limited to 65,536 UTF-8 bytes and 32
evidence items; large logs and artifacts travel as immutable references and
digests rather than inline callback content.

Start with the public objects exported by `codex_collaboration_harness`; see
[`docs/verification.md`](docs/verification.md) for the exact verification
contract and [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the lifecycle.

The primary API is `CollaborationHarness`. Its explicit stages include `plan`,
`claim`, `execute`, effect reconciliation, continuation/ACK, and
`verify_mission`; `run` composes one complete settled cycle. The worker's
`predicate_satisfied` field is advisory. Only an exact parent-owned
`MissionSnapshotReadback` may change mission truth. `Executor` and
`ContinuationTransport` are adapter protocols. All public evidence records are
immutable dataclasses, and `InMemoryStore` is a deterministic reference store
rather than production persistence.

For a repository-level review, including provenance, public-data hygiene,
tests, the synthetic demo, and import smoke check, run:

```bash
make check
```

For the complete release predicate, including removal of reproducible packaging
state, deterministic sdist metadata, two byte-identical builds,
source/wheel/sdist parity, isolated
installation, CLI smoke test, and checksums, run:

```bash
make release-check
```

Networked verification of the public Nokiy component ref, exact Git trees,
ancestry, license, and modification notice is deliberately separate:

```bash
make check-components
```

The packaged protocol schemas and cross-language golden vectors live under
[`src/codex_collaboration_harness/protocol`](src/codex_collaboration_harness/protocol).
The external-runtime request and terminal envelopes are bound to
`protocol_version=tura-collaboration/v1`. The preferred Native profile also
packages schemas for the task projection, execution profile, and exact
`[TURA_NATIVE_TERMINAL_V1]` callback.

## What Is Verified

The public suite verifies the state-machine and ownership invariants implemented
by this repository. A passing run means the in-memory reference behaved as
specified for those fixtures. It does **not** prove:

- durable or distributed lease safety;
- cryptographic receipt authenticity;
- exactly-once delivery across process or network failures;
- correct authorization for real tools or irreversible effects;
- isolation of an external worker;
- compatibility with every Codex or third-party runtime;
- the results of the non-public internal benchmark described in this repo.

Read [`docs/trust-boundaries.md`](docs/trust-boundaries.md) before adapting the
reference to production effects.

## Project Status

This is an early reference implementation. The API may change before a stable
release. Source acceptance, a packaged candidate, installed adoption, and a
real runtime integration are separate states and must not be inferred from one
another.

## Provenance and Affiliation

The code in this repository is an original, from-scratch, domain-neutral
reference implementation. It is informed by prior work with collaboration
runtimes and evidence systems, but it does not contain private task corpora,
raw conversations, local session identities, protected runtime receipts, or
source copied from those systems. See [`docs/provenance.md`](docs/provenance.md).

This is an independent project. It is not an official OpenAI product and is not
endorsed by OpenAI. "Codex" identifies the intended collaboration context; no
OpenAI source code is included.
